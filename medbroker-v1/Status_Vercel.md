MedBroker Lead Management System — Project Status (VERCEL VERSION)
==================================================
Last updated: 27 September 2026
Scope: this file tracks ONLY the Vercel + Neon Postgres deployment —
frontend/api/ + frontend/api-lib/ + frontend/src/. It does NOT cover the
separate Azure Functions/Azure SQL codebase (api/src/, infra/), which is
frozen and out of scope for this project going forward (Mark will start
a separate Claude project for any future Azure customer build). Read
alongside Project_Context_Vercel.md — that one is architecture and
standing conventions; this one is current build state.

SPLIT AGAIN, 18 August 2026: this file had grown to 14,150 lines / ~862 KB
(~215,000 tokens) by combining live current-state tracking with a
permanent, verbatim session-by-session build log dating back to 21 July
2026 — reading it in full every session, as the standing protocol
required, was consuming most of a session's usable context before any
actual work began. The full historical log (§21 onward, unedited) now
lives in Status_Vercel_Archive.md. This file holds ONLY current state,
the outstanding-items list, and standing patterns — read this file in
full every session; consult the archive (or use project knowledge search
— the intended way to reach it) only when a specific past decision's
full rationale is needed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
0. CURRENT STATE — READ THIS FIRST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REWRITTEN FROM SCRATCH 18 Aug 2026 — the previous version of this block
was written 13 Aug 2026 (end of session 21) and had gone stale in the
five days since: it still described the Reports page rebuild as an
unstarted "second priority for the next session." It is not. That work
happened, extensively, across sessions 22 and 23, and this rewrite is
verified against a fresh GitHub hydration (codeload tarball, 18 Aug
2026) plus a clean `npm install` / `npm run build` / `npx vitest run`
(48/48 passing) on that hydration — not carried forward from this log's
own prior claims.

REPORTS PAGE — FULL GROUND-UP REDESIGN: COMPLETE AND LIVE. What was
flagged in the 13 Aug version of this block as "not started, deserves
its own dedicated session" was in fact built, iterated on extensively
against Mark's direct feedback, and shipped across sessions 22-23 (§156
through §191). Donut breakdowns for Won/Lost (by Region, by Portfolio),
Cancellation Reasons, Loss Reasons, and Meeting Type; a real pipeline
funnel; upgraded KPI cards; consistent shared card tokens throughout.
The authoritative technical account of the final design lives in
Project_Context_Vercel.md's "Donut pattern" and "STANDING LAYOUT
PRINCIPLE" sections, which a session working directly on this stayed
current throughout — a session-log-shaped reconstruction of how it got
there (§179-191, clearly marked as reconstructed rather than first-hand)
lives in the archive, closing a gap this file's own §190 entry had
already flagged honestly rather than silently.

CLOSE AS LOST — BUILT AND VERIFIED, 24 Aug 2026. Full detail in the
OUTSTANDING ITEMS section immediately below (first entry). Short
version: a genuine gap Mark found live-testing — no path to Closed Lost
for a lead that only ever cancels/goes quiet, never once held a
meeting — closed with a new frontend entry point into the existing
saveOutcome() call, zero backend changes. Not yet deployed (no
migration required, so "deployed" here just means Mark applying the
delta ZIP).

POPIA ERASURE NOW CLOSES OPEN APPOINTMENTS — BUILT AND VERIFIED, 24 Aug
2026 (same session, continued). Full detail in OUTSTANDING ITEMS
immediately below. Short version: eraseLeadPII()/restrictLead() only
ever touched the Lead row; an open Appointment kept showing in every
Active view indefinitely for a subject who'd withdrawn consent. Now
closes to ClosedLost with a new, distinct lostReason ('ConsentWithdrawn',
migration 038) — counts as a genuine Lost in Reports, Mark's explicit
call. NOT YET DEPLOYED — migration 038 needs to run against Neon.

DATE FORMAT CONSISTENCY SWEEP — BUILT AND VERIFIED, 25 Aug 2026. Full
detail in OUTSTANDING ITEMS immediately below (first entry — session
crossed midnight SAST, hence the date change from the entries above).
Short version: Mark found the SAR form showing two different date
formats side by side; audit turned up FOUR conventions in play
app-wide, including raw unformatted ISO strings in two spots. Now one
standard everywhere read-only ('d MMM yyyy', Mark's explicit choice) —
twelve files. A genuine custom date-picker component, so editable
native inputs can match too, is explicitly deferred as a separate
follow-up, not forgotten. NOT YET DEPLOYED — pure frontend change, no
migration, applying the delta ZIP is the whole deployment.

CUSTOM DATE PICKER — BUILT AND VERIFIED, 25 Aug 2026 (same session,
continued — the follow-up deferred above, done same day). Full detail
in OUTSTANDING ITEMS immediately below (first entry). Short version:
new DatePicker.jsx replaces native `<input type="date">` on
internal/staff forms only (Mark's explicit scope call) — LeadNew,
LeadDetail, AppointmentDetail, Tasks, AppAdmin; the three Portal forms
deliberately keep the native input for its mobile OS-picker advantage.
NOT YET DEPLOYED — pure frontend change, applying the delta ZIP is the
whole deployment.

LEAD IMPORT DATEOFBIRTH BUG — FOUND AND FIXED, 25 Aug 2026 (same
session, continued). Full detail in OUTSTANDING ITEMS immediately below
(first entry). Short version: found while building Mark a test CSV, not
reported by him — SheetJS silently corrupts a 'YYYY-MM-DD' dateOfBirth
column (both plain CSV text and a genuine Excel date cell) into an
unusable serial number, failing 100% of import rows silently. Fixed in
parseRows() (LeadImport.jsx) before the test file was ever delivered.
DEPLOY THIS BEFORE TESTING — the accompanying test CSV will fail on the
currently-live version.

CSV TEMPLATE GAINS idNumber — 25 Aug 2026 (same session, continued
again). Full detail in OUTSTANDING ITEMS immediately below (first
entry). Short version: Mark noticed his test file had an idNumber
column the in-app "Download CSV template" button didn't offer, and
asked for the template to include it too — both tabs' template buttons
and hint text updated to match. Same delta ZIP as the entry below it.

MODAL OVERLAY DRAG-SELECT BUG — FOUND AND FIXED, 24 Sep 2026. Full
detail in OUTSTANDING ITEMS immediately below (first entry). Short
version: Mark reported the Create User email field closing the modal
when selecting its text, plus a "disappearing" password-visibility
toggle — both traced to ONE root cause, a gap in every modal's
outside-click-to-close guard that a text-selection drag can trigger by
accident. Checked scope before fixing just the one instance reported:
found and fixed the same pattern in 12 overlay handlers across 7 files.
CONFIRMED LIVE 27 Sep 2026 — mouseDownOnOverlayRef present in all 7
files in commit e1c112e (verified against a fresh codeload hydration).

LEADS LIST FOLLOW-UPS — 29 Sep 2026, medbroker-leads-followups-20260929-0747.zip. Journey band now
redraws live on resize (it used to need a refresh); "Source: <name>" under
the job title with the name column growing to fit; "Longest without
contact" sort. Next: Lead Detail journey + vertical audit-log timeline
(canvas mock-up first).

LEADS LIST JOURNEY BAND — 28 Sep 2026, medbroker-leads-journey-20260928-2022.zip. The approved
canvas design (second revision) built, theme-following from the start.
With this, the agreed UI-refresh order (Reports, Agent/Broker Detail,
Appointment Detail, Lead List) is complete.

SIGNATURE PANELS FOLLOW THE THEME — 28 Sep 2026, medbroker-theme-following-heroes-20260928-1745.zip. The
report heroes (Reports, Agent, Broker, Appointment Detail) were a fixed
dark navy in every theme; Mark found that awkward. Every colour on them now
comes from per-theme --hero-* / --path-* tokens (themes.css). Leads list
journey column approved (second canvas revision, captions inline past the
today line) — to be built next, theme-following from the start.

APPOINTMENT DETAIL JOURNEY — 28 Sep 2026, medbroker-appointment-journey-20260928-1343.zip. LeadJourney:
this one lead's path from lead created to outcome on a real time scale,
approved by Mark from the canvas mock-up unchanged. One additive backend
field (appointment closedAt). BranchFlow.jsx was still on main at the
start of this session — STILL TO DELETE on GitHub if not done since.

ORBIT ON THE ROLE-PAGE HEROES — 28 Sep 2026, medbroker-orbit-heroes-20260928-0908.zip. Mark
picked "Orbit" from four canvas options; applied to Agent Detail (calls)
and Broker Detail (appointments). Reports' Won vs Lost keeps its flow (see
the rule in Project_Context_Vercel.md). MUST DELETE ON GITHUB:
medbroker-v1/frontend/src/components/viz/BranchFlow.jsx (nothing imports
it any more; build is fine either way).

BROKER APPOINTMENTS FLOW — 28 Sep 2026, medbroker-broker-appointments-20260928-0837.zip. Broker Detail's
signature panel is now AppointmentFlow (Mark's suggestion): this period's
appointments by where each stands today. ValueStroke moves to a
"Signed policy value" section. Conversion-ratio flag resolved (see the
session entry). BreakdownRing.jsx confirmed deleted from main.

AGENT DETAIL + BROKER DETAIL REBUILT — 27 Sep 2026 (night), medbroker-agent-broker-detail-20260928-0813.zip.
Same chart language as Reports: CallFlow hero (Agent), ValueStroke hero
(Broker), MetricStrip, shared TrendLines, ReasonRows for meeting outcomes.
Two additive backend fields (getAgentDetailReport activity `future`;
getBrokerDetailReport `meetingBreakdown`). STILL TO DELETE ON GITHUB from
the previous delivery: medbroker-v1/frontend/src/components/viz/
BreakdownRing.jsx (still on main at the start of this session; unused).
Full account: "SESSION 27 SEP 2026 (NIGHT)" in OUTSTANDING ITEMS.

WON VS LOST + APPOINTMENT ANALYSIS REBUILT — 27 Sep 2026 (evening),
medbroker-reports-outcome-flow-20260927-2205.zip. Every ring on Reports replaced, from a canvas mock-up Mark
approved: OutcomeFlow (region -> won/lost -> loss reason), PortfolioSplit,
SplitFigures (meeting type), ReasonRows (cancellation reasons). Trend lines
and sparklines now monotone curves (Mark's request). MUST DELETE ON GITHUB:
medbroker-v1/frontend/src/components/viz/BreakdownRing.jsx (a ZIP can't
delete; nothing imports it any more, so the build is fine either way).
Full account: "SESSION 27 SEP 2026 (EVENING)" in OUTSTANDING ITEMS.

CI: now at .github/workflows/ci.yml (Mark moved it, 27 Sep) — first green
run in the Actions tab still to be confirmed; F-05 closes on that.

REPORTS PAGE COMPLETED — 27 Sep 2026 (later still), medbroker-reports-complete-20260927-2103.zip.
Every chart and metric row below the PipelineJourney hero rebuilt in the
same hand-built, interactive chart language (MetricStrip, TrendLines,
BreakdownRing in components/viz/). Recharts REMOVED from the app. One
backend change (additive): trend buckets that haven't happened yet carry
`future: true`. Full account: "SESSION 27 SEP 2026 — REPORTS PAGE
COMPLETED" in OUTSTANDING ITEMS below. No migration.

CI LOCATION FIXED (27 Sep 2026, evening): Mark moved ci.yml to
.github/workflows/ci.yml — confirmed on a fresh hydration.

REPORTS HERO (PipelineJourney) — DELIVERED 27 Sep 2026. Designed and
browser-verified 24 Sep 2026 (app-design-pass skill), but the code NEVER
made it into any delivery ZIP — commit e1c112e (the 27 Sep delivery)
carried the e2e suite that tests the hero, but not the hero itself, so
three interaction tests failed against main. Reconstructed from the
session transcript, with every verified fix, in
medbroker-reports-hero-20260927-1511.zip. Full account: the "SESSION 27 SEP
2026 (LATER)" entry in OUTSTANDING ITEMS below. Pure frontend, no
migration — applying the ZIP is the whole deployment.

§192 — INDEPENDENT SECURITY AUDIT, 22 Aug 2026, AND FOUR FIXES CLOSED
SAME DAY. code-audit skill (independent-reviewer role, no fixes made
during the audit itself) ran a security/build/known-defect-regression/
POPIA-FAIS pass against a fresh hydration, producing
MedBroker_Security_Audit_Report_20260822.docx (Admin project knowledge).
No Critical findings; core auth/IDOR/SQLi/encryption/POPIA-erasure
posture confirmed sound. Two High and two Low findings were fixed in a
same-day follow-up session (separate from the audit itself, per the
skill's own independence rule):
  - F-01 (High) — GET /api/appointments/available-to-claim was
    returning Lead email/mobile to a Broker before they'd claimed the
    appointment (APPOINTMENT_SELECT is shared with other, legitimate
    full-detail views, so the fix strips leadEmail/leadMobile inside
    listAvailableToClaim()'s own result mapping, not the shared select).
  - F-02 (High) — toCsv() (SAR export, audit-log export) didn't
    neutralise a leading =/+/-/@ before writing a cell, so a prospect-
    submitted Lead name reaching a CSV opened later in Excel could
    trigger formula/DDE execution. Fixed with the standard OWASP
    leading-apostrophe guard in escapeCell(), applied before the
    existing comma/quote/newline handling. helpers.js had zero test
    coverage before this — helpers.test.js added (9 tests, including the
    combined formula+comma case) so this doesn't silently regress.
  - F-08 (Low) — four local inputStyle object literals (LeadDetail.jsx
    x3, AppointmentDetail.jsx x1) used directly by native <select>
    elements were missing color, the exact "invisible text on dark
    themes" pattern this project's known-defect list already tracks.
    Added color: 'var(--ink)' to each, matching what tokens.js's shared
    s.select/s.formInput already do correctly. Re-checked every other
    <select> in the app individually after fixing these four (not just
    the ones sharing the inputStyle variable name) — all 60 remaining
    instances route through s.formInput/s.select directly or via
    spread, all of which already carry color. No further instances.
  - F-09 (Low) — EventDetail.jsx's maxWidth: '1000px' had no
    counterpart on EventList.jsx, so opening an event visibly narrowed
    the page. Removed; EventDetail.jsx now matches EventList.jsx's
    unconstrained width, consistent with every other list/detail pair.
Verified via a second fresh GitHub hydration (confirmed zero upstream
drift since the audit), `npm run build` (clean), `npx vitest run`
(57/57, up from 48 — the 9 new helpers.test.js cases), `npm run lint`
(same single pre-existing plugin-version error as the audit found, nothing
new). Five findings remain open by design, not urgency — F-03 through
F-07 either need a platform/contractual decision (KMS funding, Neon
region confirmation, a commissioned pen test) or are low-cost follow-ups
(rate limiting, CI pipeline) appropriate for the next working session,
not this same-day patch. Full detail, evidence, and remediation guidance
for all eleven findings — fixed and open alike — is in the audit report
itself; this entry is a pointer, not a duplicate.

MEETING/APPOINTMENT ATTEMPT HISTORY: built (§164), then partially
reworked (§172, 15 Aug) — Cancelled and Missed/No-show split back out
into separate, independently reportable outcomes with a structured
cancellation-reason field, reversing part of §164's own original design,
with a genuine data recovery via migration 034. Confirmed present in the
live schema (MeetingAttempt table, cancelReason column, CHECK
constraints on status/cancelReason) via direct hydration.

MIGRATIONS: confirmed by Mark on 18 Aug 2026 — migration 034 (and
everything through §191) has been run against Neon. The earlier flag in
this section (based on a confirmation that predated migration 034) is
resolved; no longer an open item.

SESSION 18 AUG 2026 — REPORTS PAGE KPI-CARD CONSISTENCY, USER GUIDE AND
GLOBALADMIN GUIDE BOTH TAKEN TO v0.2, ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM BLOCKED.
Reports.jsx / ReportsWidgets.jsx: Won vs Lost's four-metric row (Won,
Lost, Win Rate, Avg Days) switched from plain text to the same KpiCard
treatment Appointment Analysis already used — added a `customValue`
prop to KpiCard for the one genuinely compound value on the page (Avg
Days is two fmtDays() results, not one). DonutBreakdown card minHeight
raised from a flat 184px to clamp(210px, 20vw, 250px) on desktop (a
flat 210px on mobile deliberately — vw scales off the full viewport,
which breaks on a narrow portrait screen). Build clean, 48/48 tests,
diffed clean against a fresh hydration. Delivered as
medbroker-reports-cards-20260818-1600.zip.
MedBroker-User-Guide.docx and MedBroker-GlobalAdmin-Guide.docx both
rewritten to v0.2 (from v0.1, dated 31 Jul 2026 — five weeks stale).
User Guide: the meeting-outcome overhaul (Held-Interested/Held-Not-
Interested/Cancelled-with-structured-reason/Missed), the collapsed task
types (Callback and Assign Broker only, both non-tick-off-able by
design — Reschedule/Outcome tasks no longer exist), Manual Entry's move
to its own page with mandatory Products, the Claimed appointment
status, the unassigned-appointment warning, and the rebuilt Reports
page's real breakdowns. GlobalAdmin Guide: SMTP/Stripe/Paystack now
DB-backed via the Integrations page (env vars demoted to fallback-only),
two new flags (auth.sso.disableLocalFallback, security.kmsEncryption.
enabled), the Stripe/Paystack payment-provider correction (Stripe does
not support South Africa as a merchant country — flagged as a CAUTION
box, not a footnote), POPIA SAR reclassified from Phase2/not-built to
Operational/built, and a new environment-variables block for the KMS
four. Both rendered to PDF and visually checked before delivery.
Architecture diagrams (HTML microsite) — BLOCKED, not done this
session. Past-conversation search found it: MedBroker-Architecture-
Overview.html, built 10-11 Aug with six embedded diagrams (system
architecture, four ERDs, one payment sequence) in the Midnight theme —
but the file itself isn't in this project's knowledge, only referenced
in an old conversation. Cannot update a file not held anywhere
accessible; risk of silently rebuilding it from scratch and losing the
real Midnight-theme work already done was judged worse than leaving it
open. Needs Mark to upload the actual file (or its Mermaid/Draw.io
sources) before this can be picked up.

FOUR ITEMS PREVIOUSLY LOGGED AS "FIXED, NOT YET APPLIED TO THE LIVE
REPO" ARE NOW CONFIRMED LIVE — verified directly against the fresh
hydration, not assumed from this log's own prior notes:
  - Mixed-basis conversion ratios (§158) — reportService.js's conversion
    fields are the plain ratio, not a percentage, across Broker
    conversion and all four §151 breakdown reports.
  - Products on Lead (§159) — mandatory, manual-entry-form-only,
    LeadNew.jsx validates "Select at least one product."
  - Unassigned/unclaimed appointment warning (§160) — Notification type
    AppointmentUnassignedWarning present across schedulerService.js and
    four other files.
  - xlsx CVE fix (§157) — package.json's xlsx dependency is
    "npm:@e965/xlsx@^0.20.3", closing CVE-2023-30533/CVE-2024-22363.

RESPONSIVE-DESIGN AUDIT (§176): complete across the admin pages
(UserAdmin, AppAdmin, FeatureFlags, Integrations, LeadImport, LeadNew).
Included a real parallel-session conflict caught and corrected before
delivery — a different, later session had already extracted Manual
Entry out of LeadImport.jsx into its own LeadNew.jsx page; the fix was
re-applied to the correct, current file rather than silently reverting
that other session's work. Confirmed live: LeadNew.jsx exists as its own
page, gated on role only.

VERCEL FUNCTION COUNT: confirmed exactly 12/12 on this hydration — still
zero headroom, still Hobby's hard ceiling. Any new top-level API surface
needs a consolidation first.

BUILD HEALTH (29 Sep 2026, on main + the leads-follow-ups delta):
clean `npm run build`; `npx vitest run` 68/68; browser suite 119/119 (one
of those is the deliberately test.fail()-marked tasks.enabled item);
`npm run lint` — the same single pre-existing plugin-version error plus
the known JSX-usage false-positive warnings.
CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml delivered 27 Sep 2026 as a STANDALONE file
(repo root, outside medbroker-v1/) — NOT live until Mark creates it in
github.dev. Once live, unit + browser suites run on GitHub's servers on
every push, drag-and-drop commits included; deployment is unchanged. The
browser suite ALSO keeps running in the sandbox every session as part of
the protocol's verification step — CI is the between-sessions net, not a
replacement for it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
0b. OUTSTANDING ITEMS — by priority
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 29 SEP 2026 — LEADS LIST FOLLOW-UPS.

Mark, from the live list: (1) what did "Assign on the phone cards" mean —
answered: the desktop table's Assign/Reassign buttons (Unassigned rows)
aren't on the phone cards; left as is. (2) Source back on the row as
"Source: <name>" under the job title, text always visible, the column
growing and the journey compacting. (3) The band needed a page refresh
after the window narrowed (screenshot: today line and captions
off-screen). (4) Add "Longest without contact".

  - RESIZE BUG, ROOT CAUSE: LeadRowJourney's SVG sat in the cell's normal
    flow at its measured pixel width, so the table's auto layout held the
    column at that width; the ResizeObserver never saw the column shrink.
    Fix: .lrj has a fixed height and the SVG is absolutely placed — the
    column sizes the drawing, never the reverse. Regression test (resize
    1600 -> 1100, every caption inside the band) proven to FAIL on the old
    component.
  - Name cell (and Agent cell) nowrap; "Source: …" under the job title on
    the table and on the phone cards. The band keeps its 360px minimum.
  - Sort key 'quiet' (models/lead.js enum + leadService whitelist): leads
    with the broker (AppointmentScheduled) or Closed always last, then by
    last contact (latest call or booking, else created) — the band's own
    rule. Correlated subqueries on indexed leadId. A toggle button,
    "Longest without contact", in the filter row (aria-pressed); Clear Sort
    & Filters resets it.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 68/68; browser suite 119/119 (3 new);
screenshots at 1500px and after a live narrow to 1100px.

DELIVERY: medbroker-leads-followups-20260929-0747.zip — frontend/api-lib/services/leadService.js,
frontend/api-lib/models/lead.js, frontend/src/pages/LeadList.jsx,
frontend/src/components/viz/{LeadRowJourney.jsx, viz.css},
e2e/interactions.spec.js, both status docs. No migration.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 28 SEP 2026 (NIGHT) — LEADS LIST JOURNEY BAND.

DESIGN (canvas, two revisions; Mark approved the second): a journey band
down the list — every lead's last 60 days on ONE shared scale, today at
the right, drawn in the Appointment Detail journey's language; captions
inline past the today line, fading from the line's colour into their own
(Mark: captions under the line looked "in the middle of nowhere").

BUILT:
  - viz/leadRowModel.js (pure, 6 unit tests) — reached = not NoAnswer /
    Voicemail / WrongNumber; "quiet" = over 7 days since the last contact
    on a lead still with the agent (a lead with an open appointment is with
    the broker and reads "Booked", never quiet — the broker's meetings
    aren't on this list); outcome from the latest appointment (ClosedWon /
    ClosedLost at closedAt) or a lead closed with no appointment
    ("Closed", at updatedAt — no separate closed date on Lead).
  - viz/LeadRowJourney.jsx — the row journey; the whole journey is one
    button (aria-label summary, hover/focus card with source, created,
    calls, last contact, email). The card is position: fixed from the
    button's rectangle because the table scrolls sideways inside an
    overflow container (the 24 Sep clipping lesson). Clicks bubble to the
    row and open the lead as before.
  - LeadList.jsx — the band replaces Job Title, Source and Added: occupation
    moves under the name (email to the hover card), source to the hover
    card, the band's start point shows the lead's age. The band header
    keeps Added's sort (by lead age). Occupation is still a filter but no
    longer a sortable column — flagged to Mark. Phone: a card per lead with
    the journey in a band-coloured strip (the table used to scroll
    sideways at 390px).
  - leadService.listLeads — additive `journey` per lead from three small
    queries on the page's ids (last 60 days' calls; last call + count ever;
    latest appointment's booked/status/closed dates). The paged query,
    COUNT and ORDER are untouched.
  - Band colour = the theme's hero base tinted 7% toward --path-a, so it
    reads as a band in light themes too; every colour from tokens.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 68/68; browser suite 116/116 (new: every
caption state + the focus card; a click on a journey still opens the
lead); screenshots — all four themes, hover card, phone (Linen, Midnight).
Fixed from them before delivery: the "60 days ago" label clipped at the
band's edge; phone captions running out of the card and the today line
crossing out of the strip.

DELIVERY: medbroker-leads-journey-20260928-2022.zip — frontend/api-lib/services/leadService.js,
frontend/src/pages/LeadList.jsx, frontend/src/components/viz/
{LeadRowJourney.jsx, leadRowModel.js, leadRowModel.test.js} (new),
viz/viz.css, e2e/{fixtures.js, interactions.spec.js}, both status docs.
No migration, no dependency change.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 28 SEP 2026 (EVENING) — SIGNATURE PANELS FOLLOW THE THEME.

Mark: "The static theme on the reports across the various application
themes looks awkward. Could we make these switchable?" — and the same rule
wanted for WayPoint's light and dark themes.

WHAT CHANGED: each theme in themes.css gains hero tokens — --hero-bg,
--hero-wash, --hero-solid (base colour for dot rings), --hero-border,
--hero-ink, --hero-strong, --hero-mut, --hero-accent — and the journey
gradient --path-a/-b/-c. Midnight: the same navy as before. Ember: a warm
dark panel, the path ember-orange into gold. Terra: a light parchment
panel, path olive into ochre (kept clear of --pl-won's sage). Linen: a
light panel, the logo blues with the cyan end deepened (#0E8FA8) to keep
3:1 against white. Light panels get a hairline border.
Every fixed colour on a .pj-panel descendant replaced: viz.css (all
rgba(234,242,250,…)/rgba(255,255,255,…) → color-mix on --hero-ink; #fff →
--hero-strong; navy → --hero-solid), and in JSX the gradient stops,
#17B6C9 → --hero-accent (CallFlow, AppointmentFlow, LeadJourney), the
orbit's hatch and sibling-darkening target, PipelineJourney's badge
fallback and fixed amber, ValueStroke's rgb ramp (now color-mix along
--path-*), OutcomeFlow's gradient start. data-theme="dark" removed from
the panels (it had no CSS behind it). Rule recorded in
Project_Context_Vercel.md and in the app-design-pass skill (delivered as an
updated .skill — design-language.md, pitfalls.md, SKILL.md's check list).

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 62/62; browser suite 114/114; screenshots of
all four heroes in all four themes (16), reviewed per theme.

DELIVERY: medbroker-theme-following-heroes-20260928-1745.zip — frontend/src/themes.css, frontend/src/components/viz/
{viz.css, PipelineJourney.jsx, OrbitPanel.jsx, CallFlow.jsx,
AppointmentFlow.jsx, LeadJourney.jsx, ValueStroke.jsx, OutcomeFlow.jsx},
both status docs. No backend, migration or dependency change.

NEXT: Leads list journey column (approved design), theme-following.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 28 SEP 2026 (AFTERNOON) — APPOINTMENT DETAIL: ONE LEAD'S JOURNEY.

Mock-up first (Design canvas: signed in the page, open with a reschedule
and a future meeting, lost with no meeting held, phone); Mark approved it
as it was.

BUILT: viz/LeadJourney.jsx (drawing, interaction) + viz/leadJourneyModel.js
(every date and status rule, pure, unit-tested). On Appointment Detail,
between the topbar and the detail cards; read-only — every edit still
happens in the sections below exactly as before.
  - Real time scale: waypoints at their actual dates; nudged only so none
    sit closer than 30px (same-day lead + booking), order kept.
  - Per meeting number, the CURRENT attempt (latest createdAt — the rule
    appointmentService already uses) is the waypoint: held = solid;
    scheduled in the future = hollow beyond Today; scheduled in the past
    with nothing logged = hollow "Not logged yet". Earlier Rescheduled /
    Cancelled / Missed attempts are small hollow markers on the path.
  - Outcome: Signed (value, product count) / Lost (reason) / Returned to
    leads, at closedAt; while open, a "Today, day N" line and the path
    dashed to any meeting still to come.
  - Brackets name each stretch ("7 days to book", "13 days to second
    meeting, 1 cancellation"); text shortens, then drops, when a stretch is
    too narrow for it.
  - Headline + generated subtitle ("Signed after 25 days"; "Day 26: second
    meeting on 3 Oct"; "No meeting was held" on a closed deal, "yet" only
    while open).
  - Every waypoint/marker is a real button; hover/focus shows date, day of
    the journey, what happened, cancellation reason. Meeting NOTES are
    deliberately not shown (can hold personal information; they live in
    the Meetings section). Phone: the path runs down the page.
  - Dates are Johannesburg calendar days (a timestamp logged 00:30 SAST is
    that day, not the previous UTC day); date labels built by hand ("3
    Oct") — toLocaleDateString('en-ZA') gave "03 Oct" in Node, caught by
    the unit test.
BACKEND: appointmentService APPOINTMENT_SELECT gains a.closedAt (additive;
the column already existed). Page state gains firstName, lastName,
leadCreatedAt, bookedAt, closedAt, updatedAt; an outcome save sets
closedAt locally so the journey updates without a refetch.
FIXTURE: APPOINTMENT_DETAIL still carried the retired `meetings` array
(§164), so the page had always rendered with no meetings in the browser
suite; now the real meetingAttempts shape.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 62/62 (5 new model tests); browser suite
114/114 (new: headline, subtitle, a marker's detail card, the future
meeting); screenshots — open in the page (Linen), marker hover (Midnight),
signed, lost, phone. Fixed from them before delivery: an empty band under
single-tier journeys (height now fits the tiers used); "2 meetings" -> "Two
meetings"; "No meeting held yet" on a closed deal.

DELIVERY: medbroker-appointment-journey-20260928-1343.zip — frontend/src/components/viz/{LeadJourney.jsx,
leadJourneyModel.js, leadJourneyModel.test.js} (new), viz/viz.css,

SESSION 28 SEP 2026 (LATER) — ORBIT ON THE AGENT AND BROKER HEROES.

Mark asked for other ways to show the broker's appointments, "premium,
futuristic, infographic-like". Four options on a Design canvas (Orbit,
Constellation, Dial, Lanes) with honest trade-offs; recommended
Constellation, Mark chose Orbit. He then asked whether to offer Orbit as a
switchable view wherever the flow appears, or pick one. Recommended — and
he agreed — pick by DATA SHAPE, no switch: a switch doubles build and test
on every page and lets two people discuss different pictures of the same
report; and Orbit can't honestly draw Won vs Lost (two independent
breakdowns, region and outcome — a ring would drop one). So:
  hierarchy (total -> parts -> sub-parts)  -> Orbit
  items moving between two breakdowns      -> Flow
  stages in sequence                       -> Journey
Orbit went on Agent Detail and Broker Detail; Won vs Lost keeps its flow.

BUILT: viz/OrbitPanel.jsx — inner ring the parts, outer ring the sub-parts,
a tick ring with one tick per item (past 120 items one tick per N, evenly
spaced, and the panel says "Each tick on the outer ring marks N calls" —
142 calls in the test data gives 71 ticks of 2), legend with every count
and share always visible (angles are hard to compare; no figure depends on
one). Hover/focus on a segment or legend row (real buttons) steps the rest
back and puts that part's count and share in the centre; a child lights
its parent and a parent its children. Siblings sharing a colour (three
loss reasons; no answer / voicemail / wrong number) step darker toward the
panel navy so neighbours differ in lightness — found in the first
screenshot. CallFlow and AppointmentFlow keep their names and data logic
and now render OrbitPanel; BranchFlow.jsx retired (DELETE ON GITHUB).
Screen-reader labels now say "1 appointment", not "1 appointments".

TESTS: role-hero tests rewritten for the orbit (centre readout, dimming,
child-lights-parent, 31 ticks and no note for the broker) plus a new one
for tick scaling (142 calls -> 71 ticks + the note). 113/113.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 57/57; browser suite 113/113; screenshots —
both heroes, Midnight and Linen, Lost hover, a child focused, 390px phone.

DELIVERY: medbroker-orbit-heroes-20260928-0908.zip — frontend/src/components/viz/{OrbitPanel.jsx (new),
CallFlow.jsx, AppointmentFlow.jsx, viz.css}, e2e/interactions.spec.js,
both status docs. DELETE on GitHub: frontend/src/components/viz/
BranchFlow.jsx. No backend, migration or dependency change.

NEXT: Appointment Detail — one lead's journey (canvas mock-up first).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 28 SEP 2026 — BROKER APPOINTMENTS FLOW; FLAGS RESOLVED.

Mark asked (a) for flagged items to be fixed as we go, (b) where the
Meeting outcomes change was, (c) whether the Broker should get an
appointments report like the agent's calls report.

(b) Meeting outcomes is on Broker Detail (Reports -> click a broker's row
in Broker Performance, or a Broker's own Reports link), below the figures.
It was live — main at the start of this session matched the delivery.

(c) YES — AppointmentFlow (viz/AppointmentFlow.jsx) is now Broker
Detail's signature panel: this broker's appointments booked this period,
each once by its CURRENT status — Signed so far / Still open (met and
still deciding, or not met yet) / Lost (by loss reason, "Not captured"
hatched) / Returned to leads. One cohort, one clock (createdAt), so the
bands sum to the Appointments figure. New backend rows
getBrokerDetailReport.appointmentFlow (additive). "Signed so far" is
deliberately not the strip's Signed (closed this period, whenever booked);
both are labelled so on screen. ValueStroke gains a 'plain' variant and
moves to a "Signed policy value" section — one bold panel per page.
CallFlow and AppointmentFlow now share one engine, viz/BranchFlow.jsx
(CallFlow re-verified by tests and screenshot).

(a) CONVERSION RATIO FLAG — resolved by correcting the LABEL, not the
metric. On checking the code, the mixed basis (signed by closedAt ÷
appointments by createdAt) is Mark's recorded decision of 14 Aug 2026
(§157/§158, "most accurate metric, industry standard"), used across every
Conversion Ratio on Reports — a throughput ratio that can exceed 1, not
the summed-counts error the hero headline had. What WAS wrong was the
27 Sep strip note, "Signed per appointment", implying a share of those
appointments. Now "Signed this period ÷ booked this period". Reverting
§157 would need Mark's say.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 57/57; browser suite 112/112 (new: broker
appointment flow incl. the Not captured branch; value-stroke test moved to
the section); screenshots — Broker Detail Midnight full page, phone, Lost
hover; Agent hero re-checked after the BranchFlow refactor.

DELIVERY: medbroker-broker-appointments-20260928-0837.zip — frontend/src/pages/BrokerDetail.jsx,
frontend/src/components/viz/{BranchFlow.jsx, AppointmentFlow.jsx} (new),
viz/{CallFlow.jsx, ValueStroke.jsx, viz.css}, frontend/api-lib/services/
reportService.js, e2e/{fixtures.js, interactions.spec.js}, both status
docs. No migration, no dependency change.

NEXT: Appointment Detail — one lead's journey (canvas mock-up first).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 27 SEP 2026 (NIGHT) — AGENT DETAIL AND BROKER DETAIL REBUILT.

Mark's call: continue the refresh in the agreed order. Both pages are the
reports Agents and Brokers actually land on (App.jsx routes them to
/reports/agent/:id and /reports/broker/:id), so this is their Reports.

AGENT DETAIL:
  - CallFlow (viz/CallFlow.jsx) — signature dark panel replacing the Call
    Outcome Breakdown list: calls -> Reached / Not reached -> outcome.
    Valid as a flow: one outcome per CallAttempt, so bands sum to calls.
    "Not reached" (no answer, voicemail, wrong number) is a grouping this
    chart adds, stated in the panel's own subtitle. Its "ended in a
    booking" count is a CALL outcome and can differ from Appointments
    booked (appointments created) — documented in the component.
  - MetricStrip for the seven §148 figures; Calls made and Appointments
    booked carry sparklines from the weekly activity.
  - Weekly call-activity bars -> shared TrendLines (generalised 27 Sep with
    series/defaultHidden/label props; Reports passes nothing and is
    unchanged).
  - Recent Lead Activity: Lead.status now plain language ("In progress",
    "Appointment booked") — the raw enum was on screen.
  - BUG FIXED: the old bars decided "future" from calls === 0 && booked
    === 0, so a genuinely quiet PAST week was greyed out as if it hadn't
    happened. getAgentDetailReport now flags future buckets explicitly
    (additive), same as the dashboard trend.
BROKER DETAIL:
  - ValueStroke (viz/ValueStroke.jsx) — signature dark panel replacing the
    Products Sold list: signed policy value as one continuous stroke, a
    segment per product sized by value (the 23 Jul value-not-count rule
    kept), coloured along the logo gradient. Every product row shows count
    sold, value and share; a product sold with no value keeps its row.
  - MetricStrip for the seven figures.
  - Meeting Outcome Summary ("3 / 5" strings) -> "Meeting outcomes": first
    and second meetings as ReasonRows, from a new numeric
    meetingBreakdown (additive; meetingSummary unchanged). Counts meeting
    ATTEMPTS, said on screen. Its old "Signed (of all appointments)" row
    duplicated the Signed and Conversion figures and isn't repeated.
  - NOT CHANGED, flagged: the conversion ratio divides signed (closedAt
    clock) by appointments (createdAt clock) — the same mixed-clock issue
    fixed in the hero headline. Pre-existing, left as is pending Mark's
    call.
SHARED: dark-panel text rules in viz.css (the app has no dark token set
for data-theme="dark"; hero labels use fixed colours, as PipelineJourney's
do). BreakdownRing/ring history unaffected.

TESTS: smoke suite now covers /reports/agent/:id and /reports/broker/:id
for Agent, Broker and GlobalAdmin — never covered before (no fixture
existed; the pages rendered their error state). Real-shape fixtures added.
Five new interaction tests (call-flow trace; quiet past week vs future;
plain status labels; value stroke incl. zero-value product; meeting
outcome shares).

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 57/57; browser suite 111/111; screenshots
reviewed — both pages desktop Linen and Midnight, 390px, hover states.
Fixed from the screenshots before delivery: middle-column labels sitting
on the outgoing bands (moved above the nodes; beside them on a phone);
muddy outcome bands on the dark panel (opacity raised there only); the
detail card covering the traced band (moved to the empty top-left).

DELIVERY: medbroker-agent-broker-detail-20260928-0813.zip — frontend/src/pages/{AgentDetail.jsx,
BrokerDetail.jsx}, frontend/src/components/viz/{CallFlow.jsx,
ValueStroke.jsx} (new), viz/{TrendLines.jsx, viz.css},
frontend/api-lib/services/reportService.js, e2e/{fixtures.js,
interactions.spec.js, smoke.spec.js}, both status docs. No migration, no
dependency change. Diffed against a fresh hydration of main.

NEXT: Appointment Detail — one lead's journey. A new signature, so a
canvas mock-up first (Mark's preferred rhythm), then Lead List.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 27 SEP 2026 (EVENING) — WON VS LOST AND APPOINTMENT ANALYSIS
REBUILT; ROUNDED TREND LINES.

HOW IT WAS DECIDED: Mark found the rings small and unimpactful. Asked
whether bars were really the studio answer, the honest reply was: bars beat
rings for comparing categories (length reads more accurately than angle),
but what makes it studio-level is answering each section's question and
carrying the product's own concept. Proposed "where journeys end" — a flow
continuing the hero's Won/Lost fork. Mark asked for a static mock-up first
(a Design canvas, Midnight theme, this period's real figures), then
approved it.

WHAT CHANGED (same endpoints, same API fields, nothing dropped):
  - OutcomeFlow (viz/OutcomeFlow.jsx) replaces the Overall, By Region ·
    Won/Lost and Loss reasons rings: region -> Won/Lost -> loss reason,
    bands in the logo blue turning into the outcome colour. Every node is a
    real button; hover/focus traces what's connected and shows a detail
    card (top-right corner on desktop, clear of the traced path — the
    first placement covered it; below the label on a phone). On a phone
    the flow stops at Won/Lost and loss reasons follow as ReasonRows.
  - PortfolioSplit replaces the By Portfolio · Won/Lost rings: lost left of
    a centre line, won right, then the portfolio's win rate.
  - SplitFigures replaces the Meeting Type ring; ReasonRows replaces the
    Cancellation reasons ring. Both keep value and share always visible.
  - Trend lines and sparklines: monotone curves (viz/curve.js), Mark's
    request. Monotone, not generic smoothing — never overshoots, so no
    invented peaks or dips.
  - Removed: DonutBreakdown, CATEGORICAL_PALETTE (ReportsWidgets.jsx),
    WonLostPair (Reports.jsx), BreakdownRing.jsx (DELETE ON GITHUB).

DATA-SEMANTICS FINDINGS (these shaped the design, recorded as standing
rules in Project_Context_Vercel.md):
  1. PORTFOLIO RINGS WERE STATING SOMETHING FALSE. reportService counts a
     deal in every portfolio it covers (deliberate, 21 Aug), so the parts
     can exceed the deals — live data showed "4 total" for 3 won deals and
     "6 total" for 3 lost. A ring asserts parts-of-a-whole. PortfolioSplit
     compares each portfolio on its own, with a note that says when the
     overlap shows.
  2. Lost includes leads closed with NO appointment (regionNoAppt query);
     loss reasons exist only on appointments. The difference is drawn as
     its own branch, "Closed before an appointment".
  3. There is no region x reason breakdown, so tracing a region lights its
     region -> outcome bands only. (The mock-up traced Western Cape through
     to a reason — illustrative, and it would have been invented data.)
  4. Appointment Analysis is deliberately NOT a flow: Booked counts
     appointments created this period, Cancelled counts meeting attempts
     logged this period — two clocks.

FIXTURES/TESTS: fixture now has one lost lead with no appointment (lost 12,
reasons 11) so the new branch is exercised. Ring test replaced by four:
flow region trace + card; the no-appointment branch; portfolio split and
its note; reason rows + meeting type plain labels.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 57/57; browser suite 98/98; screenshots
reviewed — desktop Midnight and Linen, 390px phone, region hover, Lost
focus, phone focus, rounded trend and sparklines. Two issues found in them
and fixed before delivery: phone bands 12px long with overlapping column
headings (label column and outcome label re-proportioned); the detail card
covering the traced path (moved to the corner).

DELIVERY: medbroker-reports-outcome-flow-20260927-2205.zip — frontend/src/pages/Reports.jsx, frontend/src/

NEXT (agreed order): Agent Detail and Broker Detail in the same chart
language, then Appointment Detail (one lead's journey), then Lead List.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 27 SEP 2026 — REPORTS PAGE COMPLETED (app-design-pass, Mark's
choice of next step over Appointment Detail / Lead List).

WHY: after the hero landed, the page used two chart languages — the
hand-built interactive hero, and Recharts donuts/lines/sparklines with no
keyboard interaction — and every metric row was a grid of identical
cards. Both are named in the skill as the generic look to avoid.

WHAT CHANGED (visual/interaction only — same endpoints, same data, same
filters, same permissions, same section order):
  - MetricStrip (viz/MetricStrip.jsx) replaces KpiCard everywhere on the
    page: Executive summary, Policy Value, Won vs Lost, Appointment
    Analysis, Agent/Broker self-view. One hairline-divided panel per row.
    Same value, delta, lowerIsBetter colouring and sparkline series.
    Sparklines answer hover and arrow keys with an INLINE readout (e.g.
    "W38: 61") in place of the delta line — inline, not a floating card,
    because the strip clips its rounded corners.
  - TrendLines (viz/TrendLines.jsx) replaces the Recharts LineChart inside
    TrendChart: same five series, same separate policy-value scale (shown
    only when that series is on), same clickable legend and defaults
    (Lost and Policy value hidden). Hover/arrow keys snap to a period;
    one card lists every visible series. Legend entries are real toggle
    buttons (aria-pressed). Straight segments, not curves.
  - BreakdownRing (viz/BreakdownRing.jsx) replaces the Recharts PieChart
    inside DonutBreakdown. Every §175-§191 rule kept (centre total, legend
    beside with value and % always visible, card chrome/width/minHeight,
    both empty states). New: hover or focus a category to isolate it and
    show its count/share in the centre; "Not captured" is hatched, not
    flat grey.
  - Won vs Lost and Appointment Analysis: the four/five repeated "No
    prior-period data" lines are replaced by one Section subtitle saying
    the same thing once.
  - Keyboard focus uses the app's own :focus-visible ring (index.css).

CORRECTNESS FIXES, separate from the design work:
  1. FUTURE PERIODS DRAWN AS ZEROS. getDashboardReport returned buckets
     not yet reached as five genuine-looking zeros, so every trend line
     and sparkline crashed to 0 at "today". reportService.js now adds
     `future: true` to those buckets (zeros kept for any summing
     consumer); the chart stops at the last real period and hatches the
     rest ("Still to come"). Regression test proven to FAIL with the fix
     removed.
  2. RAW ENUM ON SCREEN: the Meeting Type ring showed "InPerson"; now "In
     person" (same wording as LeadDetail's picker).
  3. INTERNAL DESIGN NOTE ON SCREEN: Policy Value's subtitle read "Real
     prominence, not just another KPI card." — a build note, not user
     copy. Now "What this period's closed deals were worth."
  4. Recharts removed from frontend/package.json (nothing else imported
     it): Reports JS bundle 406 KB -> 33 KB. package-lock.json change is
     deletions only.

TEST FIXTURES CORRECTED (e2e/fixtures.js): the dashboard fixture had the
wrong field names for wonVsLost (arrays instead of counts, avgDaysWon),
policyValueBreakdown (array instead of object) and appointmentAnalysis
(all zeros), so Won vs Lost, Policy Value and Appointment Analysis always
rendered their empty states and had never been exercised in a browser.
Now the real reportService shapes, including a real `future` bucket and
"Not captured" categories. The broker report fixture lacked appts/signed/
policyValue ("RNaNm" in Broker Performance) — also fixed; a fixture gap,
not an app bug (the real query always returns numbers).

TESTS: four new in interactions.spec.js (trend keyboard + future stop;
legend toggle; ring legend focus -> centre; sparkline keyboard readout).
The hero fork test is now scoped to .pj-panel, since the Won vs Lost
legend rows are buttons named "Closed Won"/"Closed Lost" too.

VERIFIED: build clean; vitest 57/57; browser suite 95/95; screenshots
reviewed at 1440px and 390px, Linen and Midnight, hover and keyboard focus
on the trend, a sparkline and two rings. Three issues found in the
screenshots and fixed before delivery: a doubled focus ring (my outline on
top of the app's own); "Still to come" running off the chart on phones
(label now only where the band is >= 90px); an empty meta line under
metrics with no comparison figure. Screenshots used fallback fonts.

NOT VERIFIED IN A BROWSER: the Agent/Broker self-view strip — App.jsx
routes Agents and Brokers to /reports/agent/:id and /reports/broker/:id,
so the self-view branch of Reports.jsx isn't reachable through the UI.
Built to the same component; flagged, not assumed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 27 SEP 2026 (LATER) — COMMIT e1c112e VERIFIED; REPORTS HERO
ACTUALLY DELIVERED; CORRECTIONS TO THE ENTRY BELOW.

WHAT e1c112e (the 27 Sep delivery, = main) CONTAINS, verified against a
codeload hydration of that exact commit: e2e/ suite, root package.json
(@playwright/test 1.56.0), EventDetail.jsx zero-RSVP guard, the modal
overlay fix in all 7 files, and the 27 Sep status docs. WHAT IT DOES NOT
CONTAIN, AND NEVER DID: the Reports hero (components/viz/, hooks/
useElementWidth.js, Reports.jsx wiring). It was built and verified in
the 24-26 Sep session's sandbox and never packaged — that session's
final ZIP was built delta-only on the wrong assumption that the hero had
shipped earlier. Consequence on main: the three "Reports pipeline hero"
tests in interactions.spec.js failed (baseline run today: 87 passed, 3
failed — exactly those three). Mark applied everything he was given;
the gap was in what was delivered, not in what was deployed.

RECONSTRUCTED AND DELIVERED THIS SESSION, from the original session's
transcript, carrying every fix that session verified: the headline sums
only the four Lead.createdAt-scoped stages ("N leads still in play" —
summing all six mixed three different clocks); Won/Lost tooltip shares
use closedTotal; colour-coded conversion % badges; mobile label and
badge collision fixes; the tooltip-clipping fix (washes on ::before, no
overflow:hidden on the panel). ONE NEW CORRECTION found in today's
screenshots: the desktop Closed Lost label overran the 220px plot and
sat on the panel's bottom edge — plot now 260px with the spine held at
y=118 (identical position to the approved design). Two defensive
additions with no visual effect: a stages.length < 6 guard, and
aria-hidden on the decorative SVG (the waypoint buttons carry the labels).
PipelineHealth and stageColour() retired from ReportsWidgets.jsx (grep
confirmed no other call sites). Verified: build clean, vitest 57/57,
browser suite 91/91 including all three hero tests, and screenshots
reviewed at desktop/390px, Linen/Midnight, hover and keyboard focus.
Screenshots used fallback fonts (the suite's fixtures stub Google Fonts);
the CSS is unchanged from the version whose type was checked at 2x on
24 Sep.

ADJACENT FIX: UserAdmin.jsx's user LIST still read user.portfolios.length
/ user.products.length unguarded — the entry below records this crash as
FIXED, but only UserModal's edit-form init was guarded. Now guarded in
both places. Not a production incident (userService.js COALESCEs both to
ARRAY[]), but the suite's fixture-shaped crash was real. New regression
test in interactions.spec.js, proven to FAIL against the unfixed file
before the guard was added.

CI — WHY IT NEVER LANDED, AND WHAT CHANGED. The entry below and
Project_Context_Vercel.md said the suite is "run by CI". No CI workflow
ever reached the repo: ci.yml was packed into the 27 Sep ZIP as a second
top-level folder (.github/), which the app-design-pass skill's own
pitfalls file warns against (macOS hides dot-folders; a two-root ZIP
unzips into a wrapper folder). It had also never been explained to Mark.
Once explained — GitHub runs the tests on its own servers after every
push, needs no CLI, and does not affect Vercel deploys — Mark chose to
keep it. Delivered this time as a standalone file with its exact path,
plus a repo-root package-lock.json the workflow's `npm ci` needs (the
27 Sep version would also have failed on that: no root lockfile
existed). Every workflow step except the Chromium download was run in
the sandbox on a clean copy with CI=true: vitest 57/57, build clean,
browser suite 91/91, HTML report written to the artifact path. No lint
job (one known pre-existing lint error would fail every run). F-05 (CI
pipeline) CLOSES on the first green run in the Actions tab — not before.

COUNT CORRECTION for the entry below: "FIVE FOUND, FOUR FIXED" does not
match its own list. Of the five: two app-code fixes (EventDetail
zero-RSVP guard; UserAdmin — partial until today), one response-shape
inconsistency that isn't a bug (eventsApi.get wrapping), two deliberately
left open (tasks.enabled first-render redirect; AppointmentDetail has no
headings). Plus one bug in the suite's own helper (expectHealthyPage),
fixed.

DELIVERY: medbroker-reports-hero-20260927-1511.zip — Reports.jsx,
ReportsWidgets.jsx, UserAdmin.jsx, components/viz/ (PipelineJourney.jsx,
Tooltip.jsx, viz.css), hooks/useElementWidth.js, e2e/interactions.spec.js,

hydration of main (no upstream drift since e1c112e) — isolated to exactly
those files. Nothing to delete on GitHub. No migration.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 27 SEP 2026 — BROWSER REGRESSION SUITE BUILT (app-design-pass
skill's own mandatory requirement), FIVE REAL PRE-EXISTING BUGS FOUND
AND FOUR FIXED. [CORRECTED — see "27 SEP (LATER)" entry above: the
count, the CI claim and the hero's delivery status below are wrong.]
Continuation of the 24-26 Sep 2026 Reports redesign —
that session ended with the PipelineJourney hero verified via a
throwaway screenshot harness; this one replaced that with the
permanent Playwright suite the skill actually requires (e2e/, repo
root; "run by CI" was untrue at the time — see entry above), and in the process of driving every page for every
role through a real browser for the first time, found bugs that had
been shipping invisibly the whole time — not introduced by recent
work, just never exercised this way before. Full technical account
(fixture-shape findings, the two screenshot-methodology corrections,
the test-helper polling bug) lives in Project_Context_Vercel.md's own
"Browser regression suite" entry, not repeated here.

BUGS FOUND, FOUR FIXED:
  1. UserAdmin.jsx crashed the entire page for any user record missing
     `portfolios`/`products` arrays (no `?.` guard) — FIXED.
  2. EventDetail.jsx threw a NaN-attribute React warning for any event
     with zero RSVPs — a real, normal state every event starts in —
     FIXED (same guard already used for the adjacent attendancePct
     calculation, just not applied to two nearby lines).
  3. eventsApi.get() wraps its response in `{ event: {...} }`, unlike
     appointmentsApi/leadsApi which don't — undocumented until this
     session; not a bug in itself, but the inconsistency is worth
     knowing before writing the next fixture or consumer against it.
  4. tasks.enabled defaults to false in FlagContext, and the /tasks
     route's redirect check fires on the synchronous first render,
     before the async /flags fetch can ever resolve and override it —
     NOT FIXED, out of scope for this pass, needs a real design
     decision (show a loading state before gating? change the
     default?). Documented as a permanently-marked-failing regression
     test (interactions.spec.js) rather than hidden or worked around,
     so it stays visible in CI until someone deliberately fixes it.
  5. AppointmentDetail.jsx has zero heading elements of any level
     anywhere in the file — a semantic-HTML gap, not something this
     pass fixed; the suite's own health-check was adjusted to fall
     back to confirming real rendered content instead of requiring an
     h1 every page doesn't have.

ALSO FOUND AND FIXED, IN THE SUITE ITSELF, NOT THE APP: the suite's own
`expectHealthyPage` helper took a single, un-retried content snapshot
immediately after an unrelated timeout expired — on a page that was
genuinely still finishing an async load at that exact moment, this
produced a false failure that looked exactly like a real app hang
(Supervisor role, /reports and /leads/import specifically). Spent real
time chasing this as if it were an app bug before finding it was the
test's own assertion design. Fixed with expect.poll() instead of a
single read — every role, every page, verified clean afterward,
repeatedly, not just once.

METHODOLOGY NOW ALSO IN THE app-builder SKILL (delivered as an updated
.skill file, not part of this repo; placement, evidence claims and CI
wording corrected 27 Sep (later)) — a new mandatory "Browser
regression pass" section, so a future NEW app build gets this from day
one rather than retrofitting it after bugs have already shipped
invisibly, the way this session found them here.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 24 SEP 2026 — MODAL OVERLAY DRAG-SELECT BUG, FOUND SYSTEMIC AND
FIXED ACROSS 7 FILES. Mark reported two symptoms while live-testing
UserAdmin.jsx's Create User page: the "Show password" toggle "disappears
after turning it back off", and selecting the email address to copy it
closes the whole Create User window.

ROOT CAUSE, confirmed to be ONE bug explaining both symptoms, not two
separate ones: every modal's overlay closes on an outside click via
`onClick={e => { if (e.target === e.currentTarget) onClose(); }}`. That
guard has a real gap — a browser's native click event fires on the
nearest COMMON ANCESTOR of the mousedown and mouseup targets when they
land on different elements. Dragging to select the email address
(mousedown inside the input, mouseup outside the modal card) produces a
click whose target genuinely IS the overlay, passing the guard even
though the user never clicked it — closing the modal mid-selection. The
password-toggle report is almost certainly the same mechanism: interacting
with the revealed password text triggered the same drag-outside-closes
behaviour, which reads as "the button disappeared" because the whole
modal did.

SCOPE CHECKED BEFORE FIXING JUST THE ONE INSTANCE MARK HIT, not assumed
narrow: grepped for the exact vulnerable pattern across the whole
frontend — found in 12 separate overlay handlers across 7 files, not
just UserAdmin.jsx: Tasks.jsx (NewTaskModal), EventDetail.jsx (x3 —
AddAttendeeModal, the two QR modals), LeadList.jsx
(ReassignLeadModal), AppointmentList.jsx (x2 — BuyTokensModal,
AssignBrokerModal), UserAdmin.jsx (UserModal), EventList.jsx (create
event modal), AppointmentDetail.jsx (x3 — ReassignBrokerModal,
ReturnToLeadsModal, CloseAsLostModal). Fixed all 12, not just the one
reported.

FIX, applied identically at every site: a `mouseDownOnOverlayRef` per
modal component, tracking whether the mousedown itself (not just the
resulting click) landed on the overlay. Only closes when BOTH the
mousedown and the click land on the overlay — a real click does; a
drag-selection that merely ends up there does not.

DELIBERATELY FIXED IN PLACE, NOT EXTRACTED INTO A SHARED COMPONENT:
12 near-identical small blocks, all touching this codebase's own
established convention (seen repeatedly across this project — the date/
reason dropdowns, the hint-text pairs) of duplicating a small, well-
understood JSX pattern per file rather than abstracting it into a shared
component. A shared "ModalOverlay" component would have been a bigger,
more invasive architectural change than the bug itself warranted, and
would have deviated from that established style without being asked to.
Two QR-display modals in EventDetail.jsx share ONE ref between them
deliberately (never shown simultaneously, neither holds form data worth
protecting) — every other site gets its own dedicated ref.

VERIFIED: npm run build clean across all seven touched files. npx
vitest run — 57/57, no regressions (expected — this is a pure
interaction-layer fix, doesn't touch anything the unit tests cover).
npm run lint diffed against a freshly-hydrated, untouched baseline —
identical 155 problems (1 error, 154 warnings) before and after; every
line-level diff checked individually is the same pre-existing warning
at a shifted line number from the added comments, zero new warning
text anywhere. diff -rq against the same baseline confirmed the change
is isolated to exactly the seven intended files, nothing else drifted.

NOT YET DEPLOYED. Pure frontend interaction fix, no migration — applying
the delta ZIP is the whole deployment.

FILES: frontend/src/pages/Tasks.jsx, frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.jsx,
frontend/src/pages/LeadList.jsx, frontend/src/pages/AppointmentList.jsx,
frontend/src/pages/UserAdmin.jsx, frontend/src/pages/EventList.jsx,
frontend/src/pages/AppointmentDetail.jsx.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 1 SEP 2026 — ROLE CONFIGURATION EXPLORED, NOT BUILT. No code
change this session — pure architecture discussion, prompted by Mark's
own question ("should we build a Role Configuration section for
GlobalAdmin to define new roles and configure what they can do/see"),
purely speculative, no concrete customer driving it. Full reasoning,
the six pieces it would actually take, and the concrete 93-checks/
32-files sizing of the current fixed-role model live in
Project_Context_Vercel.md's own "Role Configuration" entry — not
repeated here. DECISION: not built. Also added as a standing Stage 1
interview question in the app-builder skill (delivered separately as
an updated .skill file, not part of this repo), so any FUTURE new app
build gets asked up front whether it needs this from day one, rather
than retrofitting it later the way MedBroker would have to.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 25 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED, FOURTH ROUND) — DOWNLOADABLE CSV
TEMPLATE GAINS idNumber. Mark asked, after being told the test file he
was given had 8 columns (title..email + idNumber) while the in-app
"Download CSV template" button only ever generated the 7 required
ones — a genuine, small mismatch, not something either side was wrong
about (idNumber has always been a real, optional column parseRows()
reads via row.idNumber if present; the template just never offered it).
Mark's call: add it to the in-app template too, so both match.

BUILT: both copies of the template button (this file duplicates the
hint text + button between the CSV tab and the Subscription tab rather
than sharing a component — same pattern already established elsewhere
in this file) updated identically:
'title,firstName,lastName,dateOfBirth,occupation,mobileNumber,email,idNumber'.
Hint text above each button gained "Optional: idNumber (13 digits)."
alongside the existing "Required columns:" line, so the template's 8th
column doesn't look unexplained next to text that only lists 7.

VERIFIED: the exact new template header, with one filled-in sample row,
run through the real SheetJS parse + REQUIRED_COLUMNS check + row
normalisation (same code, same reasoning as the dateOfBirth fix
immediately below — this entry landed right on top of that one, same
file, same session) — headers correctly recognised, no missing-column
error, idNumber correctly captured. npm run build clean. npx vitest
run — 57/57. npm run lint diffed against the same fresh baseline used
for the entry below — identical to that entry's own result, the one
line that differs is the same pre-existing warning at a shifted line
number. diff -rq confirmed still exactly one code file touched,
LeadImport.jsx, on top of the entry below's own change.

NOT YET DEPLOYED — same delta ZIP as the entry below, updated to
include this on top of it; still pure frontend, no migration.

FILES: frontend/src/pages/LeadImport.jsx.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 25 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED, THIRD ROUND) — LEAD IMPORT DATEOFBIRTH
BUG, FOUND WHILE BUILDING MARK A TEST FILE, NOT REPORTED BY HIM.

Mark asked for a 10-lead test CSV for the Import Leads screen's Medical
Subscription tab, to test against "MedLeads SA — Monthly Bundle" (a
seeded MedicalSubscription record — the subscription is just which
dropdown option gets tagged onto the batch; the file format itself is
identical regardless of vendor, no per-source column mapping exists).

REAL BUG FOUND, NOT ASSUMED — before delivering a test file, tested it
end-to-end against the actual `xlsx` package (@e965/xlsx, the exact
alias this project's package.json resolves "xlsx" to — same code Vite
bundles for the browser, not a different environment). A CSV's
dateOfBirth column, formatted exactly as the screen's own hint text
asks ("YYYY-MM-DD"), gets auto-detected by SheetJS's default CSV
parsing as a date-shaped string and silently converted to an Excel
serial number (e.g. "1978-03-14" -> 28563) before parseRows() ever sees
it. String(28563) is "28563" — nothing like the original date — so the
backend's dateOfBirth.date() validation rejects EVERY row with a
dateOfBirth column. 100% failure rate, silently, no reason shown in the
UI. A second, related case found in the same investigation: a genuine
.xlsx file with dateOfBirth as a real Excel date-typed cell (not
text — common in a real vendor export, and not something a CSV can
even represent) hit the same failure a different way, same wrong
result, independent of the CSV-specific cause.

This would have hit Mark on his very first real test of a screen he'd
never used — delivering a test file that fails 100% of rows for an
undocumented reason would have been actively unhelpful, not just an
imperfect test. Fixed before delivering anything.

FIX, in parseRows() (LeadImport.jsx): `raw: true` at XLSX.read() time
stops SheetJS auto-detecting a date-shaped CSV/text string as a date at
all. `cellDates: true` makes a genuine Excel date cell come back as an
actual JS Date object instead of an ambiguous serial number. A Date
object still isn't 'YYYY-MM-DD' through plain String() (verbose locale
string, not ISO), so a new normaliseDateOfBirth() helper formats a Date
instance explicitly via its LOCAL date parts (getFullYear/getMonth/
getDate) — not toISOString(), UTC-based and able to shift the day
depending on the browser's timezone, the same class of bug
utils/dateFormat.js's own header comment documents at length for
read-only date DISPLAY (25 Aug 2026, earlier this session) — the same
reasoning applies here on the way in, not just on the way out.
idNumber was checked too and confirmed NOT actually broken — a 13-digit
value round-trips losslessly through Number, well under
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, unlike a date string which doesn't survive the
round trip at all.

VERIFIED, every step actually run, not assumed: the exact SheetJS
behaviour (before AND after the fix) tested directly against a real
generated CSV and a real generated .xlsx workbook with a genuine
date-typed cell — confirmed the bug, then confirmed the fix, for both
cases, before writing a line of the actual code change. Once the code
was written: npm run build clean. npx vitest run — 57/57, no
regressions. npm run lint diffed against a freshly-hydrated, untouched
baseline — zero new problems, the one line that differs is the exact
same pre-existing warning at a shifted line number from the added
comments. diff -rq against the same baseline confirmed the change is
isolated to exactly one file, nothing else touched.

TEST FILE ITSELF, delivered separately (not zipped — a data file for
direct upload to the running app's Import Leads screen, not a code
delivery for github.dev): medleads-sa-monthly-bundle-test-10leads.csv,
10 leads, full coverage of all ten JobTitle enum values (one row each:
Cardiologist, Dermatologist, General Practitioner, Anaesthesiologist,
Gynaecologist, Neurologist, Orthopaedic Surgeon, Paediatrician,
Psychiatrist, Radiologist), @example.com emails (IANA-reserved domain,
guaranteed non-deliverable, never risks looking like real PII), and
plausible-but-fabricated SA ID numbers (YYMMDD prefix matching each
row's own dateOfBirth, sequence/citizenship/checksum digits invented —
the schema only validates \\d{13}, no real Luhn/checksum check exists to
satisfy or fail). Every row validated directly against the actual Zod
CreateLeadShape schema (title/occupation enums, dateOfBirth format,
mobileNumber regex, idNumber regex, email format) before delivery, not
just against the frontend parser — confirmed all 10 pass.

NOT YET DEPLOYED. Pure frontend change, no migration — applying the
delta ZIP is the whole deployment. Until it's applied, the test CSV
itself will still fail on the currently-live version of Import Leads —
worth flagging directly: deploy this fix BEFORE running the test, not
after, or the test will reproduce the exact bug this entry documents.

FILES: frontend/src/pages/LeadImport.jsx.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 25 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED) — CUSTOM DATE PICKER, THE FOLLOW-UP
DEFERRED FROM THE DATE-FORMAT SWEEP ABOVE. Mark asked to do it now.

SCOPE DECIDED BEFORE BUILDING, per Mark's own front-load-scoping
preference: every native `<input type="date">` app-wide falls into two
genuinely different contexts — internal/staff-facing (desktop-primary,
~50 known users behind login: LeadNew, LeadDetail, AppointmentDetail,
Tasks, AppAdmin) vs public/prospect-facing (mobile-primary, one-time
anonymous visitors: the three Portal forms). Native date inputs trigger
the OS's own picker on mobile — genuinely excellent UX and full
accessibility for free — which matters far more for a one-time Portal
visitor than for staff who live in this app daily. Mark's explicit
answer: internal/staff forms only; the three Portal forms (PortalRegister,
PortalCheckinConfirm, PortalActivate) deliberately keep the native input,
untouched.

VALIDATION AUDIT PERFORMED BEFORE TOUCHING ANY FILE, not assumed: every
one of the six internal files' actual save/submit logic was read, not
just its JSX, to find out whether removing native `required` would
silently break anything. Found EventDetail.jsx was the ONLY file relying
purely on native HTML5 required-blocking with zero JS-side validation
underneath it — every other file (LeadNew.jsx's formErrors.dateOfBirth,
the SAR form's explicit !sarReceivedAt guard, the booking-date field's
fieldErrors.date, both EditableField/EditableFieldRow's optional-field
save-time stripping) already has its own independent validation, so
those were safe, purely mechanical swaps. EventDetail.jsx's
handleSubmit gained one explicit `if (!form.dateOfBirth)` check,
replacing exactly what that field alone silently lost.

BUILT — new frontend/src/components/DatePicker.jsx. Pure date-math
helpers (toISO/parseISO/daysInMonth/mondayFirstWeekday) verified
standalone via a plain Node script BEFORE any JSX was written — leap
years, both date-only and full-ISO input shapes, and a known weekday
(confirmed 24 Aug 2026 is genuinely a Monday) all checked correct.
Display format matches formatDate() exactly ('d MMM yyyy', the
standard from the earlier session above). Typed entry uses a separate,
strict 'DD-MM-YYYY' format (unambiguous, day-first, faster to type than
clicking through a calendar) — Enter or blur commits a valid value and
re-renders in the display format; an invalid or abandoned typed value
resets rather than getting stuck showing bad text with nothing open to
fix it. Calendar popover uses month/year <select> dropdowns in the
header rather than prev/next-arrows-only — DOB is roughly half this
component's call sites, and reaching a birth year by clicking "previous
month" 500+ times is a real, common date-picker usability failure this
was built specifically to avoid. Every <button> inside is explicit
type="button" — several call sites (LeadNew, EventDetail) sit inside a
real <form onSubmit>, where a button with no explicit type defaults to
type="submit" and would prematurely submit the form on click.
Accessibility scope stated plainly in the component's own header
comment rather than left to be discovered: Escape closes, Tab moves
between day buttons, Enter/Space selects (native <button> behaviour) —
full roving-tabindex arrow-key grid navigation was NOT built, a
deliberate scope line, not an oversight.

Value contract: plain 'YYYY-MM-DD' string in, plain string out via
onChange(value) — matches the contract EditableField/EditableFieldRow
already use for type='date', rather than a synthetic event object.
Every raw native-input call site's onChange handler had its parameter
changed from an event to a plain value to match (e.g. `e =>
f('dueDate', e.target.value)` → `v => f('dueDate', v)`) — small,
mechanical, one-line changes at each site, confirmed individually
rather than assumed uniform.

WIRED IN: LeadNew.jsx (DOB), LeadDetail.jsx (EditableField's date
branch, split out from the shared text/date/number input; the
appointment-booking date field), AppointmentDetail.jsx
(EditableFieldRow's date branch; MeetingAttemptForm's own separate date
input, including its disabled/locked-state styling for an original
meeting-1 row), Tasks.jsx (due date), AppAdmin.jsx (audit log From/To
filters, SAR received date), EventDetail.jsx (DOB, plus the new
validation check above).

REAL LINT ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED DURING VERIFICATION, not silently
shipped: two `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`
comments in the first draft of DatePicker.jsx each produced a genuine
new lint ERROR — "Definition for rule … was not found" — because this
project's ESLint config doesn't actually have the react-hooks plugin
loaded at all. Confirmed this is a pre-existing, already-tolerated gap
in the codebase's own config (useFetch.js already has an identical
disable-comment, and it already errors identically in the untouched
baseline) rather than something to route around per-file — removed both
comments from DatePicker.jsx instead, since the rule they reference
doesn't run either way, with a comment explaining why none was added
back.

VERIFIED: pure helper functions unit-tested standalone (above). npm run
build clean, including a first pre-fix run to catch nothing else broke.
npx vitest run — 57/57, no regressions. npm run lint diffed directly
against a freshly-hydrated, untouched baseline, TWICE — the first pass
caught the two real new errors above and got fixed; the second pass
confirmed the fix: error count unchanged (1, the same pre-existing
useFetch.js issue), and every one of the 6 new warnings individually
confirmed as the exact same "component defined but never used" false
positive already present in the baseline for AuditLogList,
ReturnToLeadsModal, and others — a known, already-tolerated ESLint
limitation with JSX-only component usage detection in this config, not
a new category of problem. diff -rq against the same baseline tree
confirmed the change is isolated to exactly seven files, nothing else
drifted, and confirmed directly (not assumed) that all three Portal
forms are untouched.

NOT YET DEPLOYED. Pure frontend change, no migration, no backend —
applying the delta ZIP is the whole deployment.

FILES: frontend/src/components/DatePicker.jsx (new),
frontend/src/pages/LeadNew.jsx, frontend/src/pages/LeadDetail.jsx,
frontend/src/pages/AppointmentDetail.jsx, frontend/src/pages/Tasks.jsx,
frontend/src/pages/AppAdmin.jsx, frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.jsx.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 25 AUG 2026 — DATE FORMAT CONSISTENCY SWEEP, APP-WIDE. Mark found
the SAR "Log a Subject Access Request" form showing two different date
formats side by side — a native date input rendering "2026/08/24" next
to a computed preview rendering "23-09-2026" — and asked to make date
formats consistent across the application.

AUDIT PERFORMED FIRST, not just the one form fixed: turned up FOUR
different conventions already in play for read-only (non-editable) date
display: this file's own dateFormat.js util (DD-MM-YYYY); date-fns
`format(d, 'd MMM yyyy')`, already the majority pattern (LeadDetail,
EventDetail, EventList, AuditLogList, Portal pages); `toLocaleDateString
('en-ZA', …)` producing the same visual shape via a different mechanism
(AppointmentList, AgentDetail); and, in three spots found only by
reading the actual render code rather than grepping for "format" —
Tasks.jsx's task.dueDate and task.createdAt, AppAdmin.jsx's
sub.lastImportAt — no real formatting at all, either a raw ISO string
shown straight to the user or an uncontrolled toLocaleDateString('en-ZA')
call with no options object (same unpredictable-per-browser-locale
problem as a native date input, but on plain text with no excuse).
AppointmentDetail.jsx itself was mixing two of these conventions
internally — a concrete, damning single-page example.

TWO DECISIONS PUT TO MARK BEFORE BUILDING, per his own front-load-
scoping-questions preference, since a global format choice reverses
dateFormat.js's own originally-stated direction and a 9-file native-
input replacement is a real scope call:
  1. Which format becomes the one standard? Mark's answer: 'd MMM yyyy'
     (e.g. "24 Aug 2026") — already the majority pattern, so this
     reverses dateFormat.js's own 23 Jul 2026 header comment, which had
     framed DD-MM-YYYY as the intended future-wide standard.
  2. Editable native date inputs (`<input type="date">`, used
     consistently for every editable date field app-wide — DOB, task
     due dates, first appointment date, report filters) render in the
     browser/OS locale, genuinely outside CSS/JS control without
     replacing them. Is that acceptable as a known exception, or does
     Mark want a custom date-picker component scoped as a follow-up?
     Mark's answer: No — scope a custom picker as a SEPARATE follow-up.
     Not built this session; noted here as a real, explicitly-deferred
     item, not forgotten.

BUILT — dateFormat.js's formatDate() changed from DD-MM-YYYY output to
'd MMM yyyy' (un-padded day, matching date-fns' own 'd MMM yyyy' token
exactly, so a formatDate() call and a `format(d, 'd MMM yyyy')` call are
visually indistinguishable side by side — the entire point). Verified
directly with a standalone node script before propagating anywhere:
correct output for date-only and full-ISO input shapes, correct
un-padded single-digit days, correct '—' fallback on null/empty/garbage
input.

Every DATE-only column's read-only display (confirmed against
schema.postgres.sql's actual column types, not assumed) was switched to
call formatDate() rather than just picking up the new format string —
not cosmetic-only. `new Date('2026-08-24')` parses as UTC midnight;
rendering that through the *viewer's local timezone* (as
`format(new Date(v), …)` and `toLocaleDateString` both do) can roll a
DATE-only value back a calendar day for anyone west of UTC.
formatDate() never constructs a Date object — reads the calendar date
straight out of the string — so every one of these switches fixes a
latent timezone bug alongside the format. Doesn't currently bite
anyone in practice (MedBroker's whole user base is SAST, UTC+2, always
ahead of UTC) but it's a real bug waiting for the first user or browser
in a negative offset, not a hypothetical one — AppointmentDetail.jsx's
meeting-attempt history had already independently worked around this
exact issue with a manual `T00:00:00` suffix before formatDate()
existed; this sweep removed that workaround as unnecessary, not just
reformatted around it. Files: dateFormat.js (formatDate() itself, +
formatDateTime()'s comment), LeadDetail.jsx (dateOfBirth,
firstAppointmentDate reference), EventDetail.jsx / EventList.jsx /
PortalDashboard.jsx / PortalRegister.jsx / PortalCheckinConfirm.jsx
(eventDate — three of these were on 'd MMMM yyyy', full month name, its
own outlier format, now consistent too), AppointmentDetail.jsx
(meeting-attempt history date, the T00:00:00 workaround removed; dead
date-fns import removed), AppointmentList.jsx (firstDate/date in both
the main table and the claim-pool table).

Genuine TIMESTAMPTZ values (createdAt, performedAt, attemptedAt,
callTime/followUpDateTime aliased as attemptedAt/callbackDateTime, and
similar — every one individually confirmed against schema.postgres.sql,
not assumed from the column name) were deliberately LEFT on date-fns'
`format(new Date(value), …)` — those genuinely need timezone-aware
conversion, formatDate() would be the wrong tool for them, not a
stricter one. Their format string already matched 'd MMM yyyy' at every
call site found except two:
  - Tasks.jsx's task.createdAt — was rendered as a completely raw,
    unformatted ISO string. Now `format(new Date(...), 'd MMM yyyy,
    HH:mm')`, matching AuditLogList.jsx's own established full-timestamp
    convention.
  - AppAdmin.jsx's sub.lastImportAt — was `toLocaleDateString('en-ZA')`
    with no options object, falling back to the browser's own default
    locale formatting, genuinely uncontrolled. Now
    `format(new Date(...), 'd MMM yyyy')`.
  - Tasks.jsx's task.dueDate (a genuine DATE column, confirmed against
    schema) — was also a raw, completely unformatted ISO string. Now
    formatDate(task.dueDate).

TWO DELIBERATE EXCEPTIONS, left as-is but explicitly flagged in-code
rather than silently differing:
  - AgentDetail.jsx's lastCallTime column — kept its shortened "d MMM"
    (no year) format. A narrow performance-table column where the year
    is rarely informative for a recency signal; not a DATE-only/
    timezone concern (a genuine timestamp). Worth a second look if Mark
    wants the year there too.
  - AppointmentList.jsx's leadCreatedAt — left on toLocaleDateString(),
    not switched to formatDate(): it's Lead.createdAt, a genuine
    TIMESTAMPTZ, already rendering the exact same visual shape as the
    new standard, and formatDate() would be the wrong (DATE-only) tool
    for a real timestamp.
  - PeriodSelector.jsx's getPeriodLabel() ("Month to date (August
    2026)") — a different category entirely, a named PERIOD label, not
    a point-in-time date. Left untouched, not part of this sweep.

VERIFIED: node --check clean on dateFormat.js (the one plain-JS file
touched; every other touched file is .jsx, verified via a clean
`npm run build` instead, which is the correct tool for JSX syntax —
node --check doesn't parse JSX). npm run build clean. npx vitest run —
57/57, no regressions (expected — this is a pure display-formatting
change, doesn't touch anything the unit tests cover). npm run lint
diffed directly against a freshly-hydrated, untouched baseline run —
IDENTICAL 149 problems (1 error, 148 warnings) before and after; every
line-level diff between the two lint runs, checked individually, is the
exact same warning text at a shifted line number from added comments —
zero new warning text anywhere. diff -rq against the same baseline tree
confirmed the change is isolated to exactly twelve files, nothing else
drifted: dateFormat.js, LeadDetail.jsx, EventDetail.jsx, EventList.jsx,
AppointmentDetail.jsx, AppointmentList.jsx, AgentDetail.jsx, Tasks.jsx,
AppAdmin.jsx, and the three Portal pages.

NOT YET DEPLOYED. No migration, no backend change at all — pure
frontend display formatting, applying the delta ZIP is the whole
deployment.

OUTSTANDING, explicitly deferred per Mark's own decision above, not
forgotten: a custom (non-native) date-picker component, so editable
date fields can be brought to full visual consistency too — currently
every `<input type="date">` app-wide (DOB fields, task due dates, first
appointment date, report date-range filters, SAR received date) renders
in the browser/OS locale, outside CSS/JS control. Scoping this properly
means weighing the native picker's mobile/OS-integration/accessibility
advantages against full visual control — a real design trade-off, not
just a build task, and deserves its own session rather than being
folded into this one.

SESSION 24 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED) — POPIA ERASURE/RESTRICTION NOW CLOSES
OPEN APPOINTMENTS. Mark found this live-testing (screenshot: an erased
Lead's Appointment still showing "Assigned" under the Appointments Active
tab) and asked, correctly, whether it should be Closed Lost.

THE GAP: eraseLeadPII()/restrictLead() (leadService.js) only ever touched
the Lead row — deletedAt correctly excludes the Lead from every list/
report query in this codebase (confirmed by reading reportService.js's
own WHERE clauses directly, every one already filters l.deletedAt IS
NULL), but nothing anywhere ever looked at that Lead's Appointment(s).
An open Appointment kept its live status and kept showing in every
Active view indefinitely, for a subject who'd withdrawn consent — or,
on the Restrict-and-retain path, for a subject whose processing must
have stopped under POPIA s14(6) even though their data is retained
intact for the FAIS window.

DESIGN QUESTION PUT TO MARK BEFORE BUILDING, per his own front-load-
scoping-questions preference: should an appointment closed this way
count as a genuine "Lost" in Reports (win rate, conversion, Loss Reason
breakdown), same as any other ClosedLost row, or be excluded the way
ReturnedToLeads already is? Mark's answer: include it, same treatment
as any other Closed Lost. Simplified the build considerably — zero
changes needed to reportService.js's query logic, which already defines
"Lost" strictly as status = 'ClosedLost' throughout.

BUILT:
  - Migration 038 — Appointment.lostReason's CHECK constraint gains a
    SEVENTH category, 'ConsentWithdrawn' — new and distinct, not reused
    from the existing six (PriceTooHigh/ChoseCompetitor/
    NoLongerInterested/Uncontactable/NotEligible/Other). Deliberately
    excluded from every user-facing "Reason for loss" dropdown
    (AppointmentDetail.jsx's own Outcome card, last session's new
    CloseAsLostModal) — this feature is the only code path that ever
    writes it. DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS + a plain re-ADD, not a
    pg_constraint existence guard — sidesteps the exact conname-casing
    bug migration 035 hit (21 Aug 2026 entry, this file): Postgres folds
    unquoted identifiers to lowercase on storage, so a guard comparing
    against the CamelCase spelling used in the ADD CONSTRAINT statement
    silently never matches. Verified by actually running the migration
    TWICE in a row against a real local Postgres 16 instance freshly
    loaded from schema.postgres.sql (installed in-sandbox specifically
    for this) — confirmed genuinely idempotent, not assumed from reading
    the SQL. schema.postgres.sql updated to match, reloaded clean from
    scratch afterward to confirm it's still internally consistent.
  - New appointmentService.closeOpenAppointmentsForErasure(leadId) —
    closes every non-terminal Appointment for a Lead to ClosedLost,
    customerSigned = false, lostReason = 'ConsentWithdrawn', closedAt =
    NOW(). ClosedLost, not ReturnedToLeads, deliberately: Return to
    Leads re-queues the Lead into 'Unassigned' for the next available
    agent, which is exactly wrong for a subject who's withdrawn consent.
    A Lead can have more than one open Appointment over its life (this
    file's own header) — every one still open is closed, not just the
    most recent. Also runs the same Task cleanup returnToLeads() already
    applies (a locked/terminal appointment has nothing left to confirm/
    reschedule/record). Lead.pipelineStatus deliberately NOT touched —
    same restraint anonymiseLeadRow() already applies (§12a, 20 Aug
    2026); deletedAt already does the only job that mattered.
    FUNCTIONALLY TESTED against real fixture data on the same local
    Postgres instance — an open (Assigned) appointment closed correctly;
    sibling ReturnedToLeads and ClosedWon appointments on the same Lead
    were confirmed left untouched by the same query.
  - Wired into sarService.executeSarDeletion() for BOTH outcomes, not
    just Erased — Restricted still requires processing to stop under
    s14(6), even though the data itself stays intact for the FAIS
    window.
  - Reports.jsx / AuditLogList.jsx — LOST_REASON_LABELS in both gains
    ConsentWithdrawn: 'Consent withdrawn (POPIA)'. Confirmed
    reportService.js's Loss Reason query has no hardcoded reason list
    (GROUP BY a.lostReason, COALESCE'd to 'Not captured') — the new
    category surfaces in the Loss Reasons donut automatically, no
    backend query change needed.
  - AppointmentDetail.jsx's "Reason for loss" dropdown — the new value
    renders as a conditional, display-only <option>, present ONLY when
    it's already the appointment's current lostReason. Never a normal
    selectable choice alongside the six real ones.

A REAL GAP CAUGHT MID-BUILD, FIXED IN THE SAME DELIVERY, not part of
what Mark asked for: closeOpenAppointmentsForErasure() was originally
written to just silently UPDATE the Appointment row with zero audit
trail — every other status-changing action on Appointment (saveOutcome,
returnToLeads, reassign, claim) writes its own AuditLog entry, and this
is exactly the kind of event that most needs to be independently
auditable. Fixed: the function now returns the closed appointment ids
(same "function does the work, caller records who asked" split this
file already uses for eraseLeadPII()/restrictLead() themselves,
appointmentService.js's own header), and executeSarDeletion() writes a
new AppointmentClosedForErasure entry per closed appointment
(changeDetail: newStatus, lostReason, sarId — the SAR that triggered
it). New describeEntry() case in AuditLogList.jsx renders it as "Closed
Lost — Consent withdrawn (POPIA), following a POPIA data subject
request".

ALSO FOUND WHILE REGISTERING THE NEW ACTION, FIXED ALONGSIDE IT:
SarDeletionExecuted itself — already live on the backend since §12a
(20 Aug 2026), with its own ACTION_LABELS entry and describeEntry()
case in AuditLogList.jsx — was missing from BOTH auditHandlers.js's
VALID_ACTIONS and AppAdmin.jsx's matching AUDIT_ACTIONS filter list.
Same pre-existing gap on both sides; only effect was that filtering the
audit log by action=SarDeletionExecuted silently fell through to
"return everything" instead of erroring, per parseFilters()'s own
defensive design. Not part of this feature's own scope, fixed here
rather than left to keep aging on the list.

VERIFIED: node --check clean on all three touched backend files
(appointmentService.js, sarService.js, auditHandlers.js). npm run build
clean. npx vitest run — 57/57, no regressions. npm run lint diffed
directly against a freshly-hydrated, untouched baseline run — IDENTICAL
149 problems (1 error, 148 warnings) before and after; every line-level
diff between the two lint runs is a path-prefix or line-number shift
from added comments, zero new warning text. diff -rq against the same
baseline tree confirmed the change is isolated to exactly the intended
files, nothing else drifted: appointmentService.js, sarService.js,
auditHandlers.js, schema.postgres.sql, the new migration file,
AuditLogList.jsx, AppAdmin.jsx, Reports.jsx.

NOT YET DEPLOYED. Migration 038 needs to run against Neon before this
is live — same standing rule as every migration.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 24 AUG 2026 — CLOSE AS LOST, BUILT AND VERIFIED. Mark found this
live-testing (screenshot: two Cancelled meeting attempts, no path
forward to a sales-loss outcome) and asked for it built same-session.

THE GAP: outcomeDue (AppointmentDetail.jsx) — which gates the whole
Appointment Outcome card, Customer Signed Yes/No, Closed Won/Lost — only
ever becomes true once a meeting attempt resolves to a Held outcome.
Cancelled/Missed/Rescheduled all route to "new attempt, same meeting
number, no outcome due" (§172's own routing table). A lead that only
ever cancels or goes quiet, never once held, had no path to Closed Lost
at all — Return to Leads was the only other closure action, and that's
an administrative reset (Lead -> Unassigned), not a sales-loss outcome;
it doesn't record why the deal didn't happen.

BUILT: frontend-only. New "Not progressing? / Close as Lost" button on
AppointmentDetail.jsx, visible whenever !isLocked && !outcomeDue, opens
a confirmation modal (CloseAsLostModal, mirrors ReturnToLeadsModal's own
structure) requiring a loss reason, then calls the exact same
appointmentsApi.saveOutcome() the normal Outcome card uses
(customerSigned: false + lostReason). Confirmed against
appointmentService.saveOutcome() before building: its only precondition
is current.status not already locked — it has never required a held
meeting or checked outcomeDue, that's purely a frontend gate on the
Outcome card's own visibility. So this needed ZERO backend changes — no
new migration, no new route, no new Vercel function (Hobby plan
12-function ceiling untouched).

REAL ADJACENT GAP FOUND AND FIXED IN THE SAME DELIVERY, not scope creep:
the Outcome card's render gate was outcomeDue alone, but that same card
also carries the ReturnedToLeads "locked as history" notice and the
ClosedLost Reopen button (both gated on appt.status directly, not
outcomeDue) — so ANY appointment reaching a locked status without a
held meeting (Return to Leads before a meeting, or now Close as Lost)
rendered NEITHER notice nor Reopen button, no visible confirmation of
the closed state and no undo path reachable. Broadened to
(outcomeDue || isLocked) — checked every field inside the card first;
all already disable correctly off isLocked/isClosed independently, so
this was safe. Reopen itself needed no changes — reopenAppointment()
only checks status === 'ClosedLost', not how it got there.

ALSO FIXED, found while touching this: detail.lostReason was captured
on the Appointment row (migration 030, 14 Aug 2026) but never once
surfaced in the AppointmentOutcomeSaved audit changeDetail, on ANY
outcome save, held-meeting or otherwise — added to
appointmentHandlers.js's writeAuditLog() call and to AuditLogList.jsx's
own rendering (new local LOST_REASON_LABELS map, same "short, static,
manually synced" pattern this enum's other two copies already use).

VERIFIED: fresh GitHub hydration taken at the start of this session,
read before any code was written. A second, untouched hydration kept
alongside as a baseline throughout. `npm run build` clean. `npx vitest
run` — 57/57 passing, no regressions. `npm run lint` — 149 problems (1
error, 148 warnings) vs the baseline's 148 (1 error, 147) — diffed the
two lint runs directly, the one new warning is
'CloseAsLostModal' is defined but never used, the same pre-existing
false-positive this file already throws for every other modal
component defined at module scope (ReturnToLeadsModal,
ReassignBrokerModal, MeetingAttemptForm, etc. — all flagged identically
in the baseline too), not a real issue. `diff -rq` against the baseline
tree confirmed the change is isolated to exactly three files, nothing
else drifted: AppointmentDetail.jsx, appointmentHandlers.js,
AuditLogList.jsx.

NOT YET DEPLOYED. No migration required — this is a pure application
change (frontend entry point + one audit changeDetail field), nothing
to run against Neon.

frontend/api-lib/handlers/appointmentHandlers.js,

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SESSION 21 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED, NINTH ROUND) — SAR REQUIRED ASSIGNMENT,
AUTO-COMPUTED DUE DATE, AND A LINKED TASK MATCHING LEAD/APPOINTMENT
BEHAVIOUR. CORRECTED AFTER A REAL DELIVERY MISTAKE, NOT JUST BUILT.

Full audit performed first, per Mark's explicit request — see that
entry for the sweep details, nothing new found there worth repeating
here.

THE FEATURE, per Mark's request: SAR assignment required, Target due
date auto-set to POPIA's response window rather than manually entered,
and the request creates a linked Task, editable only from the request
itself, mirroring Callback/Appointment tasks exactly. Full build
detail, the 30-day POPIA/PAIA sourcing, and the new migration are all
covered fully in this entry's original write-up two rounds back — not
repeated here, only what changed on correction.


A REAL DELIVERY MISTAKE, OWNED DIRECTLY: the SAR feature was built and
first delivered from a GitHub hydration that predated Mark applying the
previous entry's notification/task badge fix. Never re-checked before
packaging. The delivered ZIP's App.jsx and Tasks.jsx were therefore
STALE — applying it as given would have REVERTED Mark's already-working
badge fix. Confirmed via fresh hydration that no actual regression
reached his live environment (he hadn't applied the stale ZIP before
catching it), but the ZIP itself was wrong and needed rebuilding
properly, not just re-explaining.

FIXED PROPERLY, not by re-copying the old files: re-hydrated fresh,
confirmed exactly which files the badge fix touched (App.jsx,
Notifications.jsx, Tasks.jsx) versus which SAR-feature files never
overlapped with it (sar.js, task.js, sarService.js, taskService.js,
migration 037, schema.postgres.sql, AppAdmin.jsx — verified safe to
copy directly, not assumed). Tasks.jsx was the one genuine overlap —
manually re-applied the SAR-specific edits onto the CURRENT,
badge-fix-included file rather than letting either version clobber the
other. App.jsx and Notifications.jsx need zero changes from the SAR
work and are excluded from this delivery entirely — including them
again would just be re-litigating a file that's already correct.

CAUGHT AND ACTUALLY FIXED WHILE RE-VERIFYING (Mark's explicit
instruction: fix issues found, don't just flag and defer them) — two
real gaps, neither caught in the original build:
  - Tasks.jsx's linkTarget referenced task.linkedAppointment, which
    never matched taskService.js's TASK_SELECT (actually named
    linkedAppointmentId) — flagged only, not fixed, two rounds ago.
    Fixed properly this time, in the same edit that added the SAR
    branch, rather than left noted for later.
  - CATEGORIES — a SEPARATE, hardcoded array driving the Tasks page's
    own tab bar, entirely distinct from CATEGORY_META (which only
    controls a task row's styling/label) — had no 'sar' entry at all.
    Missed in the original build; SAR tasks would have displayed
    correctly inside "All tasks" but had no dedicated filter tab the
    way every other category does. Added, plus the matching role-
    visibility rule (hidden from Agent AND Broker — a SAR task can only
    ever be assigned to Admin/GlobalAdmin, so extending the exact
    reasoning this file already applies to hiding Callbacks from Broker
    and Appointments from Agent).

VERIFICATION, redone on the correctly-merged codebase, not assumed
carried over from the discarded delivery: npm run build clean, npm run
lint back to the stable 146-problem/1-error baseline (verified the one
extra warning above that baseline was pre-existing noise unrelated to
any of this session's changes, not new), 48/48 vitest. schema.postgres.sql
reloaded clean from scratch on this codebase specifically, confirming
migration 037's constraint changes are present and correct here too,
not just on the discarded working copy.

STILL OPEN, NAMED EXPLICITLY RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLICIT: the
MedBroker-User-Guide.docx / MedBroker-GlobalAdmin-Guide.docx format
issue (Outstanding item 0i, logged 20 Aug) has not been addressed —
raised again with Mark directly this round rather than left to keep
aging silently on the list.

STALENESS, FOUND AND FIXED, INCLUDING A REAL SCOPING BUG CAUGHT BY THE
LINT TOOLING BEFORE IT SHIPPED.

Mark: clearing/reading a notification updates the Notifications page
itself correctly, but the sidebar badge count doesn't resolve until a
full page refresh.

ROOT CAUSE: App.jsx's sidebar badge count is a completely separate
useFetch from whatever Notifications.jsx itself uses — it only
refetches on route change ([location.pathname] as its sole dependency).
Notifications.jsx's own handlers (markAllRead, markRead, dismiss,
clearRead) all correctly refetch() their OWN local list, but had no way
to signal the sidebar's independent fetch instance that anything had
changed. Checked whether Tasks had the identical issue before fixing
just the one reported — same fetch pattern, same
[location.pathname]-only trigger, same four mutating handlers
(toggleDone, deleteTaskHandler, reassignTask, addTask) each correctly
refetching their own list with no cross-component signal. Fixed both
consistently, not just the one Mark happened to test.

FIRST ATTEMPT WAS WRONG, CAUGHT BY THE LINT TOOLING BEFORE SHIPPING:
tried passing refetchNotifCount/refetchTaskCount down through the
<Route> elements directly from AppLayout, where the badge state
originally lived. npm run lint immediately flagged both as
'not defined' — no-undef, real errors, not warnings. Investigated
before assuming a typo: AppLayout and AppLayoutWrapper are SIBLING
components, not parent/child in the way that matters here — AppLayout
only ever receives {children}, which is CONSTRUCTED in
AppLayoutWrapper's own scope (where the <Routes> actually live) before
being passed in. A function declared inside AppLayout was never
reachable from a <Route>'s element prop, regardless of how the JSX
visually nests — confirmed by reading both component boundaries
directly, not guessed from the error message alone. This is exactly
the class of bug the lint infrastructure (added earlier this session,
after the LeadDetail.jsx colors crash) exists to catch, and it worked
on the very next thing built after it went in.

FIXED PROPERLY: moved the notifData/myTaskData useFetch calls (and
their refetch functions) from AppLayout to AppLayoutWrapper — the
component that actually owns the <Route> elements needing them.
AppLayout's signature changed from computing unreadCount/
pendingTaskCount itself to receiving them as plain props
({ children, unreadCount, pendingTaskCount }), same as everything else
it already receives from its parent. refetchNotifCount/refetchTaskCount
now correctly passed to <Notifications onNotificationChange={...}> and
<Tasks onTaskChange={...}>, called by those pages after every one of
their own mutating actions (4 in Notifications.jsx, 4 in Tasks.jsx),
on top of the existing route-change refetch — additive, not a
replacement for it.

VERIFICATION: npm run build clean. npm run lint — zero no-undef issues
after the fix (was 2 real errors after the first, wrong attempt;
correctly caught, correctly diagnosed, correctly fixed before this
delivery, not shipped and found later). 48/48 vitest, no regressions.

HAD A REAL FRONTEND GAP, FOUND BY MARK, FIXED.

Mark tested a ClosedWon appointment (John Wellington) and found the
"Edit Details" button still fully clickable. Traced it precisely rather
than assuming the previous entry's fix was simply incomplete in some
vague way: AppointmentDetail.jsx has TWO entirely separate edit
surfaces — the isLocked-gated fields inside the "Appointment Outcome"
card (verified correctly disabled last entry), and a completely
different editingDetails flow (Lead Details/Appointment Details/
Personal Details/Education/Insurance cards) triggered by a top-level
"Edit Details" button that was gated on canManage ONLY — zero isClosed
check, never touched by the previous fix at all. Checked for other
entry points into editingDetails before fixing anything — setEditingDetails(true)
has exactly one call site (startEditingDetails, called only from this
one button) — so a single fix at this point is genuinely sufficient,
not a guess.

WORTH BEING PRECISE ABOUT THE ACTUAL RISK HERE, NOT JUST THE SYMPTOM:
checked what handleSaveDetails actually does on save — it calls BOTH
leadsApi.update() (for Lead-owned fields this same form edits:
occupation, DOB, ID number, education, insurance info) AND
appointmentsApi.update() (for the Appointment-native fields). Both of
those server-side calls were ALREADY correctly rejected by the previous
entry's backend locks — Wellington's Lead is pipelineStatus = 'Closed'
(cascaded from his own appointment closing), so leadHandlers.js's PUT
lock already covered it independently. No data was ever actually at
risk of changing; the button being present was a misleading-UI bug —
looked editable, would have failed (confusingly, with two separate
errors) on save — not a data-integrity bug. Still a real bug worth
fixing at the entry point, not just relying on the backend to catch it
after the fact with a confusing double failure.

FIXED: the "Edit Details" button is now also gated on !isClosed,
deliberately NOT the broader !isLocked (which also covers
ReturnedToLeads — a status the backend PUT lock deliberately does NOT
block, per that check's own comment) — using isLocked here would have
hidden the button for a status the server would still accept a save
for, the identical class of frontend/backend mismatch in the opposite
direction. Also added the same isClosed check inside
startEditingDetails() itself as a defense-in-depth guard, matching this
file's own established pattern (the isLocked-gated Outcome card already
checks at both the trigger and the field level, not just one).

SWEPT BOTH files for any other edit-trigger button with the same class
of gap — grepped every onClick calling an edit-mode setter in both
AppointmentDetail.jsx and LeadDetail.jsx. LeadDetail.jsx's own "Edit
Details" button was already correctly gated on canEdit (which already
included !isClosed from the earlier entry) — confirmed, not assumed.
This was the only remaining gap.

VERIFICATION: npm run build clean, npm run lint shows the identical 145
problems as before this fix (144 pre-existing unused-var warnings, one
unrelated cosmetic notice) — zero new no-undef errors, confirming
isClosed is correctly in scope where referenced. 48/48 vitest, no
regressions. Replicated the exact fixed JSX condition against
Wellington's real values (status: 'ClosedWon') directly — button
correctly does not render.

NOW LOCKED FOR EVERYONE, WITH A REOPEN ESCAPE HATCH. Mark's explicit
request: "when a Lead or an Appointment is closed, it should be
uneditable... nobody should be allowed to change either whilst in a
closed state."

INVESTIGATED BEFORE BUILDING, SURFACED A REAL DESIGN QUESTION: a strict
permanent lock, read literally, means a mistake (a mis-logged call
outcome, a wrongly-closed appointment) becomes unfixable by anyone,
forever. Confirmed with Mark before writing anything — lock with an
Admin/Supervisor reopen escape hatch, not a permanent one-way door.

ALSO SURFACED WHILE INVESTIGATING: Lead already had a partial lock
(pipelineStatus === 'AppointmentScheduled', Agent-only — Supervisor/
Admin could already edit through it) but nothing at all for
pipelineStatus === 'Closed'. Appointment had NO lock of any kind at the
backend, for any status — AppointmentDetail.jsx's own frontend isLocked
already greyed out the fields, but updateAppointment() had zero status
checks, meaning the actual guarantee didn't exist, only the UI hint did
— exactly the "server-side enforcement, not just hidden UI" principle
this project already holds everywhere else.

ALSO FOUND A SEPARATE, PRE-EXISTING BUG directly relevant to the reopen
escape hatch: reopenLead()'s precondition only ever accepted
pipelineStatus === 'AppointmentScheduled' — but appointmentService.js's
own cascade moves a Lead to pipelineStatus = 'Closed' the moment its
Appointment reaches ClosedWon/ClosedLost, which made the existing
Reopen button already unusable for the single-appointment case it was
built for. Fixed as part of this delivery, not a separate one — the new
lock needed a working reopen path to actually be safe to ship.

BUILT:
  - leadHandlers.js — new lock: pipelineStatus === 'Closed' blocks the
    PUT edit endpoint for everyone, no role exemption (deliberately
    stricter than the existing AppointmentScheduled/Agent-only check
    right above it — Mark's own word was "nobody").
  - leadService.js — reopenLead() now accepts pipelineStatus === 'Closed'
    OR 'AppointmentScheduled' (previously only the latter); rejects only
    when the most recent appointment is genuinely ClosedWon — reversing
    a won deal is a bigger, separate decision than fixing a mistaken
    loss, not what this action is for.
  - leadHandlers.js — the reopen handler's audit log was hardcoding
    { from: 'AppointmentScheduled', ... } — now uses the actual
    pre-reopen status already fetched, not a stale assumption.
  - appointmentHandlers.js — new lock: ClosedWon/ClosedLost blocks the
    PUT edit endpoint for everyone. ReturnedToLeads deliberately NOT
    included — that already has its own separate re-assignment path
    and isn't "closed" in the sense this lock means.
  - appointmentService.js — new reopenAppointment(): ClosedLost only
    (same Won/Lost asymmetry as Lead, applied consistently), resets to
    InProgress, clears closedAt, deliberately preserves
    claimedByBrokerId/agentId/brokerId (this is about un-freezing the
    record, not un-claiming it), and cascades the linked Lead back to
    InProgress too if it's still 'Closed' — otherwise reopening the
    Appointment would leave the Lead locked and orphaned by the new
    Lead lock, with no obvious way back.
  - appointmentHandlers.js / api/appointments-router.js — new
    PUT /api/appointments/:id/reopen, Admin/Supervisor/GlobalAdmin only,
    mirrors handleAppointmentReturn's exact shape.
  - src/services/api.js — appointmentsApi.reopen() added.
  - LeadDetail.jsx — canEdit now excludes isClosed too (previously only
    isConverted); the existing Reopen banner and canReopen logic
    extended to cover the no-appointment call-stage-loss case, with new
    messaging for it specifically (baseLead.appointmentStatus is falsy
    for that case, which the new branch keys off).
  - AppointmentDetail.jsx — new Reopen button added to the existing
    "closed and can no longer be edited" notice, Admin/Supervisor only,
    ClosedLost only (doesn't render at all for ClosedWon rather than
    rendering disabled with no explanation) — mirrors LeadDetail.jsx's
    own handleReopenLead pattern exactly (direct button + loading
    state, no confirmation modal).

BUG CAUGHT DURING THE BUILD, BEFORE DELIVERY: handleReopenAppointment
was first written referencing `appointment.id` — the actual state
variable in this file is `appt`, not `appointment`. Caught by checking
the real declaration (line 649) before assuming, not by trusting the
name that felt natural to write.

BUG CAUGHT DURING VERIFICATION, IN MY OWN TEST SCRIPT NOT THE APP: the
first pass at testing reopenLead()'s precondition against real Postgres
used lead.pipelinestatus (lowercase) instead of the actual camelCase
alias the query returns (pipelineStatus) — produced a false "REJECT" on
two scenarios that should have passed. Fixed the test script itself
before trusting its output, not the other way around — a reminder that
verification code needs the same scrutiny as the thing it's verifying.

VERIFICATION: node --check and ESM import smoke test clean on all five
touched backend files (confirmed the new reopenAppointment import chain
resolves correctly too). npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest, npm run
lint shows the identical 145 problems as before this round (144 pre-
existing unused-var warnings, one unrelated cosmetic notice) — zero new
no-undef errors from any of this session's frontend changes. All four
reopenLead precondition scenarios (Closed/no-appointment,
Closed/cascaded-from-ClosedLost, Closed/cascaded-from-ClosedWon,
InProgress/never-closed) verified against real Postgres with the exact
query and logic from the file, all four correct. reopenAppointment()'s
actual UPDATE statements run against real seeded data — status,
closedAt, claimedByBrokerId/agentId all landed correctly, and the Lead
cascade correctly moved the linked Lead back to InProgress too.

EDIT, FIXED, PLUS NEW LINT INFRASTRUCTURE TO CATCH THIS CLASS OF BUG
GOING FORWARD.

Mark hit a blank white page clicking "Edit Details" on a Lead — browser
console showed "Uncaught ReferenceError: colors is not defined" in the
LeadDetail chunk, crashing the whole page render. Confirmed NOT
introduced by any of this session's work — never touched LeadDetail.jsx
before this — a pre-existing, dormant bug that had simply never been
triggered before, because Mark had been testing via direct Neon-console
edits rather than the app's own Edit UI up to this point. First time
this exact code path (the "Select a portfolio first" hint, shown when
editing with zero portfolios selected) actually rendered.

ROOT CAUSE: LeadDetail.jsx line 643 referenced colors.ink400, but this
file's imports only pull in `s` and `APPT_STATUS_META` from tokens.js —
`colors` itself was never imported at all. colors.ink400 does exist in
tokens.js (resolves to var(--mut)) — this was a real, simple oversight,
not a deeper design problem.

FIXED: replaced colors.ink400 with 'var(--mut)' directly — the exact
same CSS variable, and the identical pattern already used two lines
above for the sibling "Products" label in the same block. No new
import needed; minimal, matches the surrounding code exactly.

SWEPT THE REST OF THE FRONTEND for the same class of mistake (a
colors.X reference without importing colors) — this was the only
occurrence anywhere in src/. Confirmed via the new lint tooling below,
not just this one manual grep.

NEW: eslint.config.js — didn't exist before this. package.json already
had an npm run lint script, but with zero config behind it, so it
errored out immediately rather than checking anything; exactly why
this class of bug (a plain JS ReferenceError, invisible to npm run
build's transpile-only checking) went undetected. Deliberately narrow:
only no-undef and no-unused-vars enabled — not ESLint's full
recommended set, and no React-specific plugin (eslint-plugin-react,
Hooks rules), none of which are installed. Turning on a full ruleset in
one step risked surfacing a wave of unrelated pre-existing warnings
across the whole codebase as a surprise side effect of a bug-fix
delivery — a fuller lint setup (React Hooks rules especially, genuinely
worth having) is a separate, bigger decision for Mark to make
deliberately, not bundled in here. Added the `globals` package
explicitly to devDependencies (package.json) rather than relying on it
silently as an undeclared transitive dependency of eslint itself.

RUNNING THE NEW LINTER FOR THE FIRST TIME found exactly one real issue
across the whole src/api/api-lib tree — the LeadDetail.jsx bug already
being fixed in this same entry. Everything else was no-unused-vars
noise (144 warnings, mostly unused imports) and one harmless "rule not
found" notice from a leftover eslint-disable comment referencing a
Hooks-lint rule that isn't configured (cosmetic, not a code problem).
Zero other no-undef violations anywhere — real, useful confirmation
that this specific class of crash isn't lurking elsewhere.

VERIFICATION: npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest, no regressions. npm
run lint now actually runs (previously errored out unconditionally) and
confirms the fix — the ReferenceError-class issue it exists to catch is
gone.

THE PREVIOUS ENTRY, FOUND AND FIXED: "CLOSED WON" APPOINTMENTS WERE
BEING DOUBLE-COUNTED AS AN ADDITIONAL, SPURIOUS "CLOSED LOST."

Mark caught this live testing — a Lead (John Wellington) with a real,
genuine ClosedWon Appointment was showing up in the Region/Portfolio
Lost breakdowns too. Confirmed serious immediately, not minimised.

ROOT CAUSE: the previous entry's fix (and, it turned out, five
PRE-EXISTING report queries elsewhere in this same file) all assumed
Lead.pipelineStatus = 'Closed' meant "closed at the call stage, no
appointment ever booked." That assumption was wrong, proven wrong by
reading appointmentService.js directly: once ANY Appointment reaches
ClosedWon or ClosedLost and nothing else is left open for that Lead,
the Lead's own pipelineStatus gets set to 'Closed' too — for BOTH
outcomes equally, not just losses. A Lead whose appointment WON still
ends up with pipelineStatus = 'Closed'. The "no-appointment" branches
had no way to tell the two cases apart, so every Lead whose real
appointment had already closed — win or lose — was counted a second
time as a phantom "Lost, no appointment."

THIS BUG PREDATES THE PREVIOUS ENTRY'S FIX. Found the exact same flawed
condition in FIVE other places while searching the file properly this
time (a full grep for the pattern, not a single spot-check) — the
Dashboard pipeline overview (its own comment already flagged this exact
imprecision, unresolved until now), getLeadsBySourceReport,
getLeadsByPortfolioReport (a separate, pre-existing standalone report,
not the one touched two entries ago), and the Won-vs-Lost function's own
top-level Overall count and Lead Source breakdown. All five were wrong
before this session touched anything — this session's own Region/
Portfolio addition just extended an already-broken pattern rather than
introducing a new one from nothing. Worth being honest about the
verification gap that let it through: before shipping the Region/
Portfolio fix, only ONE invariant was checked (that a Lead reaching
'Closed' via the call-outcome path can't later book an appointment) —
correct, but too narrow. It didn't rule out the OTHER path that also
sets pipelineStatus = 'Closed', because that path was never searched
for. A full grep across the file for every place setting this status
would have caught it before shipping; a single spot-check didn't.

FIXED — all seven occurrences, one consistent condition added
everywhere: AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Appointment ax WHERE
ax.leadId = l.id). Unambiguous regardless of why pipelineStatus happens
to say 'Closed' — checks directly whether the Lead has ever had an
Appointment at all, not what its own status field currently claims.

PROVEN WITH REAL DATA, NOT JUST READ: seeded a Lead exactly matching
Wellington's real situation (pipelineStatus = 'Closed', a genuine
ClosedWon Appointment) alongside one exactly matching Kaveer's (same
pipelineStatus, genuinely zero Appointments) and ran all three versions
side by side against real Postgres — the appointment-scoped query, the
FIXED no-appointment query, and the OLD buggy query kept unmodified for
comparison. The old query reproduced Mark's exact symptom precisely:
ClosedLost = 2 (both leads, Wellington wrongly included). The fixed
query correctly returns ClosedLost = 1 (Kaveer only). Re-verified
specifically for the Region breakdown too, the one in Mark's own
screenshot — Wellington no longer appears on the Lost side at all.

VERIFICATION: node --check clean, ESM import smoke test clean, npm run
build clean, 48/48 vitest, no regressions.

FOLLOW-UP AGREED WITH MARK: once this delivery is applied and verified,
move to deliberate seed data rather than continuing to layer fixes onto
the accumulated ad-hoc test records from this extended testing session
— not a substitute for this fix, a separate step after it.

BREAKDOWNS MISSED LEADS CLOSED WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT, FIXED.

Mark noticed "By Region · Lost" and "By Portfolio · Lost" both showed
"No losses this period" while the Overall KPI card correctly showed
Lost: 1, and asked whether it was a data-capture gap. It wasn't — traced
to a genuine structural bug, confirmed by reading the actual queries,
not assumed:

ROOT CAUSE: the top-level Overall Lost count (closedLostCount, sourced
from `pipeline`) counts TWO different things as "Closed Lost" — a real
Appointment reaching ClosedLost, AND a Lead whose pipelineStatus went
straight to 'Closed' via a WrongNumber/NotInterested call outcome
(computeLeadStatus, leadStatusService.js), never having booked an
Appointment at all. The Region and Portfolio breakdown queries only
ever scanned the Appointment table — a Lead closed the second way is
structurally invisible to both, even though it's correctly counted in
the Overall total. Ruled out a simpler "region field just wasn't set"
explanation using the UI's own behaviour: the existing COALESCE(a.region,
'Not captured') already handles a captured-Appointment-with-no-region
case by showing a "Not captured" bucket — an empty breakdown specifically
only happens when the row isn't in the Appointment-scoped result set at
all, which is what Mark's screenshot actually showed.

Confirmed no double-counting risk before writing anything: computeLeadStatus's
own TERMINAL_STATUSES makes 'AppointmentScheduled' and 'Closed' mutually
exclusive — a Lead reaching 'Closed' this way can never also go on to
book and later close an Appointment, so adding a "no-appointment" branch
to these queries cannot double-count a Lead that already has a real
closed Appointment.

Worth noting the codebase already got this right once: the Leads-by-
Source breakdown (same file) already merges in an equivalent
srcNoApptClosedRows query for the identical situation. Region and
Portfolio were just never given the same treatment when built.

FIXED — Region: added regionNoApptRows, a Lead-scoped query mirroring
srcNoApptClosedRows's pattern exactly, grouped by Lead.region (COALESCE
to 'Not captured') rather than Appointment.region — there's no
Appointment row for this branch, and Lead.region is the field
Appointment.region is itself copied from at booking time anyway
(schema.postgres.sql's own comment on that column).

FIXED — Portfolio: this one had a genuine design question first
(flagged to Mark before touching it, not decided unilaterally) — an
appointment-less Lead was never linked to a portfolio via
AppointmentPortfolio, but may still carry portfolio INTEREST via the
separate LeadPortfolio table (captured independent of ever booking
anything). Used a LEFT JOIN through LeadPortfolio so a Lead with no
portfolio interest falls into "Not captured," and a Lead with MULTIPLE
portfolio interests fans out to contribute to each one — a deliberate
extension of the exact same fan-out behaviour portClosedCountRows
already has for real closed appointments spanning multiple portfolios
(COUNT(DISTINCT a.id), GROUP BY p.name), not a new inconsistency.

BUG CAUGHT DURING THE BUILD, BEFORE DELIVERY: the Portfolio fix's first
draft referenced lossReasonParams for its query parameters — that
variable isn't actually defined until later in the function (line 1662
vs. the new query at line ~1615), which would have thrown a
ReferenceError at runtime. Caught by checking the actual line numbers
of both definitions, not assumed from proximity in the diff. Fixed by
using portParams instead — already in scope one line earlier, identical
shape.

VERIFICATION: node --check and ESM import smoke test clean on
reportService.js, npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest, no regressions.
Both new queries run verbatim through the real @name-to-positional
rewriting logic against real Postgres, seeded with three Leads matching
the actual scenarios (closed-without-appointment + region captured;
closed-without-appointment + two portfolio interests + no region; and a
control Lead still InProgress, to confirm it's correctly excluded from
both breakdowns). Every result matched expectation exactly: region
breakdown correctly split Gauteng/Not captured; portfolio breakdown
correctly fanned out across both of the two-portfolio Lead's interests
plus a Not captured entry for the single-portfolio-less Lead, with the
breakdown's total (3) correctly exceeding the raw lost-lead count (2) by
exactly the expected fan-out amount — matching the pre-existing,
accepted AppointmentPortfolio precedent, not a new form of
inconsistency.

MARK'S LIVE TESTING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL ERASE, BOTH FIXED. Not bugs in
the sense of broken code — the erasure itself worked correctly — but
genuine gaps in what the workflow did afterward.

GAP 1 — SAR STUCK AT INPROGRESS AFTER A SUCCESSFUL ERASURE. Previously,
executeSarDeletion() always only auto-transitioned Received -> InProgress
(reusing markInProgressOnFirstExport, mirroring the Export flow), for
BOTH outcomes, requiring a manual "Fulfilled" click regardless. Mark's
question ("should this not be Fulfilled?") exposed a real design gap,
not just a missing convenience: the two outcomes genuinely deserve
DIFFERENT treatment, not the same one applied uniformly.
  - Erased: nothing further is pending on this Lead — the data is
    genuinely gone. Auto-jumps straight to Fulfilled now (Received rank
    0 -> Fulfilled rank 2 is a valid forward move per updateSarStatus()'s
    own rank check, verified against real Postgres, including that
    fulfilledAt/fulfilledById now get populated correctly — they never
    were before, since the request never actually reached Fulfilled).
  - Restricted: deliberately UNCHANGED, still only reaches InProgress.
    The record isn't gone — it's retained under a live FAIS obligation,
    pending a future scheduled purge that isn't built yet (logged
    separately as a follow-up). Auto-marking a still-fully-intact,
    still-retained record "Fulfilled" would misrepresent to anyone
    checking later whether the deletion was actually completed — this
    is a compliance-accuracy point, not just a UI nicety, so the
    distinction was worth getting right rather than picking the simpler
    "always auto-fulfil" option.

GAP 2 — EXPORT JSON/CSV STILL AVAILABLE AFTER A DELETION REQUEST HAD
EXECUTED. Confirmed in the code the buttons rendered unconditionally
for every request, regardless of type or state. Deliberately did NOT
just hide Export for every Deletion-type request, though — a not-yet-
executed Deletion request has a real, legitimate reason to want Export
available: a pre-erasure snapshot for the organisation's own records,
since once eraseLeadPII() runs there is no way to recover what was
held. So Export now hides specifically once a Deletion request has
already executed (Erased OR Restricted), not for Deletion requests as a
category:
  - Erased: exporting afterward would return a Lead literally named
    "[Erased]" with everything else nulled — not a real snapshot of
    anything, just noise.
  - Restricted: the PII is still intact, but POPIA s14(6) restriction
    means "stop processing" — pulling a full export is itself a form of
    processing this Lead was just locked out of, so allowing it would
    work against the point of the restriction.
Implementation: hoisted the existing "has this deletion executed"
lookup (previously computed inline inside the outcome-panel IIFE) up to
where sarLocked is already computed once per row, as a new
sarDeletionOutcome value, and reused it in both places rather than
duplicating the audit-lookup logic. Genuinely needed as its own signal,
not reducible to sarLocked alone — sarLocked now catches Erased
(post-Gap-1-fix, since Erased auto-fulfils), but Restricted stays
InProgress and sarLocked would miss it entirely.

VERIFICATION: node --check and ESM import smoke test clean on
sarService.js, npm run build clean (validates the AppAdmin.jsx JSX
changes), 48/48 vitest, no regressions. The Received -> Fulfilled status
jump verified against real Postgres using the actual updateSarStatus()
UPDATE statement run through the real @name-to-positional rewriting
logic (same discipline as the previous entry's hotfix, not hand-
substituted literals) — confirmed status, fulfilledAt, and
fulfilledById all land correctly.

FIXED. Mark hit this live testing the erasure feature after applying
both prior deliveries correctly — genuine production bug, not a
deployment-ordering issue this time.

Error: "db.js: query references @erased but no matching parameter was
supplied", thrown from anonymiseLeadRow() (leadService.js), inside
eraseLeadPII(), inside executeSarDeletion() (sarService.js). Root cause
found by reading db.js's toPositional() directly, not guessed: it
rewrites @name placeholders with a single regex pass over the WHOLE raw
query text (query.replace(/@(\w+)/g, ...)) — no awareness of SQL
string-literal boundaries. anonymiseLeadRow()'s email column was set via
`CONCAT('erased-', id::text, '@erased.invalid')` — the literal
'@erased.invalid' string contains the substring '@erased', which the
regex can't distinguish from a real parameter reference. No "erased" key
existed in the params object, so it threw.

REPRODUCED EXACTLY, NOT JUST THEORISED: copied toPositional() verbatim
into an isolated test and ran it against the old SQL — produced the
identical error message character-for-character, confirming root cause
with certainty before touching anything.

FIXED: the erased-email value is now built in JavaScript
(`erased-${leadId}@erased.invalid`) and bound as a proper @erasedEmail
parameter, rather than constructed with a literal '@' anywhere in the
raw SQL text — the only reliable fix given how the rewriter works, not
a one-off patch for this specific string. Swept the rest of api-lib/
for the same pattern (a literal '@' inside a SQL string literal,
outside an intended @paramName) — this was the only occurrence.

TESTING GAP THIS EXPOSED, WORTH RECORDING HONESTLY: when eraseLeadPII()
was originally built and verified against real Postgres, that
verification ran the SQL with literal values hand-substituted in via
psql — it never actually exercised db.js's own @name-to-positional
rewriting logic, because that requires a live Neon connection this
sandbox can't reach. The SQL's LOGIC was genuinely tested; the
MECHANICAL process of how the app actually assembles the query at
runtime was not, and that's exactly where this bug lived. Closed that
gap this time: copied toPositional() verbatim and ran the fixed SQL
through it for real, then executed the resulting positional query
($1/$2/$3) against real Postgres via a direct pg client — as close to
the actual production path as achievable without Neon itself. Row
result confirmed correct: firstName '[Erased]', lastName empty, email
correctly synthesised, existingCover/medicalAid both null, deletedAt
and erasedAt both set.

VERIFICATION: node --check clean, ESM import smoke test clean (both
leadService.js and sarService.js, which imports from it), npm run build
clean, 48/48 vitest, no regressions.

Reported against the deployed SAR/Deletion feature from the 20 Aug
sessions below, with screenshots.

BUG 1 — LEAD SEARCH: full name ("Kaveer Singh") returned zero results,
a partial name ("Kaveer") found the lead. Root cause confirmed by
reading listLeads()'s WHERE clause directly, not guessed: the search
only ever compared the term against firstName and lastName SEPARATELY
— "Kaveer Singh" (with a space) can never be a substring of "Kaveer"
alone or "Singh" alone, so a two-word search matched nothing. Fixed by
adding a fourth OR branch comparing against the concatenated
firstName || ' ' || lastName, alongside the existing three (not
replacing them — a single-word or email-fragment search still needs to
keep working). Verified against real Postgres with the exact reported
case plus three regression checks (partial name, lastname-only, email
fragment) — all four returned the correct row count. This is the same
`search` parameter behind both the general Leads list page and the SAR
form's "Find the Lead" box (leadsApi.list()) — one fix closes it
everywhere this search box appears, not just in Data Requests.

BUG 2 — 400 ON FIRST DELETION-REQUEST ATTEMPT: Mark's screenshot showed
the failing request in Vercel's Logs panel, but "No logs found for this
request" — nothing to trace. Read handleSarRequestsCollection()
directly: the ONLY 400 source on this route is CreateSarRequestSchema.
safeParse() failing — there is no other validation or business-logic
400 anywhere in that handler. Most likely specific cause, well-
evidenced rather than certain: the requestor-email field is
type="email", which looks like it enforces format, but this form (like
every other form in this app) submits via a button onClick, not a
native <form onSubmit> — so the browser's native email constraint
checking never actually fires. The old client-side guard only checked
`.trim()` (non-empty), while the server's Zod schema requires
`.email()` (valid format) — a genuine gap between what the button's
disabled state allowed through and what the server actually required.
A malformed address would pass the client check, reach the server, and
get rejected with a 400 — matching exactly "first attempt failed,
retry (presumably corrected) succeeded."
Two fixes, addressing both the specific bug and the general complaint
("not sure how to trace the error"):
  - AppAdmin.jsx: new isValidEmail() helper (a practical format check,
    deliberately matching Zod's .email() strictness rather than
    building something stricter than the server enforces), now gating
    both the Log Request button's disabled state and handleSarCreate()'s
    guard clause. A malformed email can no longer be submitted at all.
  - sarHandlers.js: the safeParse failure branch now calls console.warn
    with the actual field(s) and reason from parsed.error.flatten()
    before returning the 400. Previously this branch returned before
    ever reaching the catch block's console.error, so a validation
    failure was genuinely invisible in Vercel's Logs panel — exactly
    what Mark ran into. Any future 400 on this route, from any field,
    is now traceable without needing to reverse-engineer it from a
    screenshot.
Worth telling Mark directly, not just noting here: the on-screen error
banner on the SAR form (sarError, rendered via s.errorBox) was already
wired to show the specific field+reason via formatErrorBody() — which
already correctly unpacks Zod's fieldErrors shape into a readable
message. He likely did see something like "requestorEmail: Invalid
email" in the moment; it just wasn't anywhere he could go back and find
after the fact, which the console.warn now fixes going forward.

VERIFICATION: npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest, no regressions.
node --check clean on both touched backend files (AppAdmin.jsx is JSX —
validated via the production build instead, which compiled clean).
isValidEmail() tested against 9 cases (valid addresses, no-@, no-TLD,
empty, whitespace-only, plus-tags, subdomains) — all correct, including
the two malformed shapes ("kaveer", "kaveer@chartres") that would have
slipped past the old check specifically. Search fix verified against
real Postgres with the exact reported input plus three regression
cases, not just read.

REBUILT AND REPO DOCUMENT STRUCTURE ESTABLISHED. Mark asked for the
Technical Specification updated with POPIA/FAIS content, then clarified
it was a document Claude built in a past session (9-11 Aug 2026, v1.0,
19 pages, 6 diagrams) that never reached this repo or project
knowledge — found via conversation_search, confirmed genuinely absent
from a fresh GitHub hydration. Not recoverable (lived only in that
session's now-closed sandbox) and, separately, already ten days stale
regardless (SAR, the erasure feature, KMS, F1/F3 all postdate it) — so
rebuilt fresh (v2.0) rather than attempting to patch a version that no
longer existed anywhere accessible.

Diagrams (6, same count as v1.0): extracted 32 tables and 75 foreign-
key relationships programmatically from the current schema.postgres.sql,
same rigor the original build used, not approximated. All Mermaid
(erDiagram \u00d7 4, flowchart, sequenceDiagram), rendered via mmdc per the
solution-architecture skill. One flagged deviation: that skill specifies
Draw.io XML with UML stencils for the component/deployment diagram — no
Draw.io renderer was available in this build environment, so Mermaid
flowchart notation was used instead and stated plainly in the
document's own Document Control section, not silently substituted.

REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED DURING THE BUILD, WORTH RECORDING: every
embedded diagram initially rendered as a tiny, unreadable sliver.
Traced to a single line — a document-wide default paragraph style
(spacing.line = 276, meant for body-text line height) was being applied
to image-containing paragraphs too, and LibreOffice's renderer clips an
inline image's paragraph to that line height instead of letting it grow
to fit the image, unlike Word's more forgiving behaviour. Isolated with
a minimal one-image test case before touching the real document, to
confirm root cause rather than guessing. Fixed by moving that spacing
into the body-text helper specifically rather than the document-wide
default. Same "verified against real output before delivery" discipline
this project already applies to SQL — applied here to a rendering
pipeline instead.

Also fixed: a duplicate consecutive PageBreak left over from an earlier
edit, which produced one wasted blank page between Document Control and
the Table of Contents. And: replaced a dynamic Word TOC field with a
static section list after confirming (via LibreOffice's headless
conversion) that the dynamic field renders blank unless a real Word
session explicitly updates it — correctness across whatever Mark
actually opens this in was judged more valuable than a clickable,
auto-updating list.

REPO STRUCTURE: Mark separately pointed out the User Guide and
GlobalAdmin Guide were in the same situation as the Technical
Specification — built by Claude, never actually in the GitHub repo,
living only in project knowledge. Confirmed via fresh hydration. Both
now added, alongside the new Technical Specification, under a proper
docs/ structure:
  docs/technical/MedBroker_Technical_Specification.docx (new)
  docs/guides/MedBroker-User-Guide.docx
  docs/guides/MedBroker-GlobalAdmin-Guide.docx
  docs/security/MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx (already
    in repo from an earlier delivery this session, unchanged, not
    re-copied)

FLAGGED, NOT FIXED THIS SESSION: both MedBroker-User-Guide.docx and
MedBroker-GlobalAdmin-Guide.docx are plain UTF-8 text saved with a
.docx extension, not real OOXML packages — the exact same defect the
Security Findings document had before it was corrected earlier this
session. Committed to the repo as-is per Mark's literal request (repo
inclusion), not silently propagated without mention — this needs the
same docx-js rebuild treatment the Security Findings document already
got, as a follow-up, not attempted in this already-large session.

SESSION 20 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED, SECOND ROUND) — F1/F3 SECURITY FIXES
APPLIED, at Mark's explicit request ("I want these resolved"). Same
session as the two entries below.

F3 — BROWSER SECURITY HEADERS: CLOSED. vercel.json now sets CSP, HSTS,
X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-
Policy on every route. Checked the actual build output (dist/index.html)
and every external-navigation path before writing the CSP, not assumed
from a generic template: style-src needs 'unsafe-inline' (this app
styles almost entirely via React's inline style={{}} prop — thousands
of call sites, no build-time CSP-nonce system to do it properly);
Paystack/Stripe checkout is a window.location.href full-page redirect,
not a form POST or iframe, so no CSP directive touches it; Entra SSO
uses loginPopup() (a real popup window, grepped msalAuth.js — no
acquireTokenSilent/hidden-iframe anywhere), which frame-src doesn't
govern. Full reasoning in Project_Context_Vercel.md §12.
CAUGHT BEFORE IT SHIPPED: first draft embedded the CSP reasoning as
fake "//"-prefixed keys inside the vercel.json headers rule object —
JSON has no comment syntax, and Vercel validates vercel.json against a
strict schema; unrecognised keys in a headers rule risk a deploy-time
validation failure. Caught by re-reading the file, not by testing
against a real Vercel deploy (couldn't, in this sandbox) — fixed to
clean, schema-valid JSON, with the reasoning moved to Project_Context_
Vercel.md where every other config decision's reasoning already lives.

F1 — FIELD-LEVEL ENCRYPTION EXTENDED: CLOSED. medicalAid, medicalAid
Provider, existingCover, currentInsurer, policies now field-level
encrypted (migration 036), same envelope scheme idNumber already uses.
Investigated blast radius before touching anything: grepped every SQL
use of these five fields across api-lib — confirmed none are ever
filtered/sorted/grouped on (reportService.js's hits were unrelated
English text, not the columns), so no searchable-encryption workaround
was needed, unlike idNumber's blind-index hash.
Touched: encryption.js (new encryptBoolean/decryptBoolean — no
encrypted-boolean column type exists, so booleans are encrypted as
'true'/'false' text; deliberately NOT Boolean(str) on decrypt, which
would silently coerce the literal text 'false' to true), leadService.js
(listLeads/getLeadById/createLead/UPDATE_LEAD_COLUMNS/updateLead/
eraseLeadPII's anonymiser), appointmentService.js (the Lead-join query
in getAppointmentById), sarService.js (compileSubjectData), dataExport
Service.js (the bulk export). sarHandlers.js needed zero changes —
confirmed it only ever reads from compileSubjectData's already-
decrypted output, never a raw column.
listLeads() DROPS these fields entirely rather than decrypting them —
checked LeadList.jsx first (grepped for the field names, found
nothing rendered), so this was pure unused cost being fetched on every
list page load. Same "not exposed on the list view" treatment idNumber
already had.
Export (dataExportService.js): decrypted, NOT masked, unlike idNumber.
idNumber's masking is specifically about a unique government
identifier's bulk-correlation risk; a boolean or "which medical aid"
doesn't carry that same risk tier, and this export already legitimately
showed these fields in plaintext before — F1 closes the at-rest gap,
it doesn't change export policy.
Old plaintext columns kept, not dropped (same "deprecated, unused
going forward" pattern as Lead.portfolioId elsewhere) — scripts/
backfill-encrypt-lead-fields.js (new) migrates any existing plaintext
data into the encrypted columns and nulls the old ones per row, in one
UPDATE so a row is never left half-migrated if interrupted. Not run
automatically — see that script's own header for why and how to run it.

REAL BUG FOUND WHILE TRACING F1's BLAST RADIUS, UNRELATED TO F1 ITSELF:
Lead.currentInsurer has had a working input on LeadDetail.jsx (sends a
value on every save) since that page was built, but the field was
never added to CreateLeadShape (models/lead.js) — Zod silently strips
unknown keys, so the value never reached the service layer, on any
Lead, ever, from day one. Confirmed root cause by checking UPDATE_LEAD_
COLUMNS (no currentInsurer key), createLead()'s INSERT (no
currentInsurer column), and the Zod shape itself (no currentInsurer
field) — all three independently confirmed the same gap, not assumed
from one. Fixed alongside F1 since every function that needed
encrypting it also needed to actually be able to save it — encrypting
a field that couldn't be persisted in the first place would have been
functionally meaningless. Also added to the bulk export
(dataExportService.js), which never included it before for the same
reason.

VERIFICATION: fresh npm install carried over from the F3 build, clean
npm run build, 48/48 vitest. node --check clean on all ten touched
backend files (including the new backfill script). ESM import smoke
test clean on all — confirmed no circular-import issue. grepped for any
remaining raw-SQL reference to the five old plaintext column names
anywhere in api-lib/ after the edits — zero hits, confirmed nothing
missed.
encrypt()/decrypt() themselves could not be exercised live in this
sandbox — they call getFlagMeta() (a DB read, to check security.
kmsEncryption.enabled) internally, and db.js's neon() HTTP driver
cannot reach a local Postgres instance the way a raw TCP client could
(this is a pre-existing constraint of this codebase's architecture, not
something this session introduced — idNumber's own encrypt()/decrypt()
has always had this same untestable-in-isolation property). What WAS
verified live against real local Postgres: migration 036's idempotency
(ran twice cleanly, learned from migration 035's mistake last session —
correct pg_constraint lowercase comparison used from the start this
time) and the backfill script's exact SQL shape (SELECT WHERE clause
correctly caught only rows with old plaintext data and correctly
skipped a row with none; simulated UPDATE correctly nulled all five old
columns and populated all five new ones in one statement; re-running
the same SELECT afterward correctly returned zero rows). The
encryptBoolean/decryptBoolean wrapper logic itself was code-reviewed
rather than live-tested for the same DB-dependency reason, but is
low-complexity (seven lines each) and directly mirrors the already-
proven encrypt()/decrypt() pattern.

DOCUMENTATION: Project_Context_Vercel.md §12/§12a updated — Gap 2
(F1) and the browser-headers control (F3) both marked closed with
resolution detail, backlog renumbered. MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_
Findings.docx NOT regenerated this entry — see the next entry below,
which does.

SESSION 20 AUG 2026 (CONTINUED) — FAIS HOLD / POPIA ERASURE FEATURE
BUILT, same session as the architecture/compliance review below (which
was documentation-only at the time it was written — this entry
supersedes that "no code touched" framing for the session as a whole,
not a correction to what was true when it was written). Closes backlog
item 0a from the review below. Fresh hydration was already in place
from earlier this session; no re-hydration needed since nothing external
changed underneath it.

DESIGN DECISION CONFIRMED WITH MARK BEFORE BUILDING: true erasure
anonymises the Lead row in place rather than a hard/cascading delete —
preserves referential integrity (CallAttempt/Appointment/Task/AuditLog
rows pointing at the Lead) and historical reporting counts, which a
physical DELETE would have silently corrupted. De-identification is an
explicitly valid alternative to physical deletion under POPIA s14(4),
not a compromise.

BUILT:
  - Migration 035 (frontend/db/migrations/035_popia_erasure_and_restriction.sql)
    — SubjectAccessRequest.requestType (Access|Deletion), Lead.erasedAt/
    restrictedAt/retentionExpiresAt, a partial index for the future
    purge query. schema.postgres.sql updated to match.
  - leadService.js — getLeadRetentionPosition() (FAIS obligation check:
    live if the Lead has a ClosedWon/ClosedLost Appointment, retention
    running 5 years from the most recent one; ReturnedToLeads correctly
    excluded, matching the standing "never counts as Lost" rule),
    eraseLeadPII() (true erasure — anonymise in place), restrictLead()
    (restrict-and-retain — deletedAt set, PII left intact).
  - sarService.js — executeSarDeletion() orchestrates the above,
    reusing the existing markInProgressOnFirstExport auto-transition and
    the established single-audit-write convention (§131).
  - sarHandlers.js / leads-router.js — new POST /api/leads/sar-requests/
    :id/execute-deletion, Admin/GlobalAdmin gated.
  - src/services/api.js — sarApi.executeDeletion().
  - AppAdmin.jsx — request-type toggle on the Data Requests create form,
    a Type column on the list, and an "Execute Deletion" control on the
    expanded row for Deletion-type requests (window.confirm-gated,
    matching every other irreversible action in this app), showing the
    Erased/Restricted outcome — sourced from the just-returned API
    result, falling back to the already-loaded audit trail so the
    outcome still displays correctly after a reload.
  - AuditLogList.jsx — SarDeletionExecuted formatting, distinguishing
    the two outcomes in the message text (mirrors the existing
    LeadAssigned/AppointmentBrokerAssigned pattern).

BUG CAUGHT AND FIXED DURING BUILD, BEFORE DELIVERY — worth naming, same
"verified delivery over claimed delivery" principle as every other entry
in this file: migration 035's own idempotency guard for the new CHECK
constraint compared pg_constraint.conname against the CamelCase spelling
used in the ADD CONSTRAINT statement. Postgres folds unquoted identifiers
to lowercase, so that comparison never matched — the guard was silently
a no-op, and running the migration a second time (the exact real-world
scenario it exists to protect against) failed on a duplicate constraint.
Caught by actually running it twice against a real local Postgres 16
instance, not by re-reading the SQL — the same standing rule
("Raw SQL in template literals must be verified... AND tested against a
real Postgres instance") catching a real bug it was written to catch.

VERIFICATION: fresh npm install, clean npm run build, 48/48 vitest (no
regressions). node --check clean on all five touched backend files.
ESM import smoke test on all five — confirmed no circular-dependency
issue from sarService.js's new import of leadService.js (a real risk
worth checking explicitly, not assumed safe) — failures without
DATABASE_URL set are pre-existing db.js behaviour, confirmed against an
untouched file failing identically, not something this delivery
introduced. Full logic exercise against real Postgres with three seeded
Leads (no service rendered / ClosedWon 2 years ago / ReturnedToLeads
only) — every outcome matched the design exactly, including the
ReturnedToLeads exclusion, which was the trickiest part of the rule.
Scratch test file removed before packaging, not shipped.

NOT BUILT THIS SESSION, logged as follow-ups: the scheduled purge job
once a restriction's retentionExpiresAt lapses (currently marks-only);
CallAttempt/MeetingAttempt free-text redaction (deliberately not
attempted — see Project_Context_Vercel.md §12a for why). MedBroker_
Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx's F2/6.4 status is now stale
(still shows Open) — not regenerated this session, flagged for the next
one that touches security docs.

SESSION 20 AUG 2026 — ARCHITECTURE/COMPLIANCE/SECURITY REVIEW, DOCUMENTATION
ONLY, NO CODE TOUCHED. Requested by Mark ahead of the client parking this
project until Feb 2027 — wants the record straight before the gap.
Fresh GitHub hydration, no npm build/vitest run (nothing in the app
itself changed this session, so the standing pre-delivery verification
step doesn't apply — noted explicitly rather than silently skipped).
Three deliverables:
  1. Project_Context_Vercel.md §12a (new) — POPIA/FAIS compliance gap
     analysis. Confirmed both gaps Mark suspected going in are real
     (Lead erasure is soft-delete only; field-level encryption is
     idNumber-only) and corrected one stale line in the existing §12
     (SAR endpoint marked "not built" — it is, verified by reading
     sarService.js/sarHandlers.js/models/sar.js directly). Full detail
     in that section; eight items added to the OUTSTANDING list above
     (item 0) and the backlog.
  2. MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx — new dated addendum,
     Vercel-only scope sweep. The Jun 2026 content is Azure-era (Bicep,
     Key Vault, Front Door/Cloudflare) and mostly no longer applicable
     to this build; superseded findings marked as such rather than
     deleted, for the historical record. Also corrected: the file on
     GitHub was plain UTF-8 text saved with a .docx extension, not a
     real OOXML package (despite §5.4 of its own prior content claiming
     otherwise) — this delivery is a genuine .docx.
  3. White-label feasibility answered in chat, not written to a file —
     cosmetic rebrand (logo mark, page title, login/SSO copy, email
     footer) is low-effort and low-risk; repurposing the data model for
     a non-medical lead-management vertical is a materially bigger
     decision, kept separate rather than conflated.

CLOSED, 18-19 Aug 2026: full data export (JSON + Excel), ID Number
visibility, and Lead/Appointment field parity — all three built and
delivered in the same session as the architecture diagram update above.

ID NUMBER: end-to-end. LeadNew.jsx (manual entry) and LeadDetail.jsx
(view/edit) both now have a 13-digit-validated ID Number field;
leadService.getLeadById() decrypts for display, updateLead() encrypts +
blind-indexes on write (mirroring createLead()'s existing pattern —
one input field, two stored columns, handled outside the generic
UPDATE_LEAD_COLUMNS loop). sarService.js's stale "the one place this is
ever shown in plaintext" comment corrected. Real, deliberate widening of
where this PII surfaces in the app — flagged to Mark explicitly at the
time, not a silent side effect.

LEAD/APPOINTMENT FIELD PARITY: AppointmentDetail.jsx now shows the same
Contact Details/Education/Insurance Information sections LeadDetail.jsx
already had (dateOfBirth, idNumber, whatsappNumber, university/year/
degree, hospitalOrPractice, existingCover, policies, medicalAid[+
provider]) — previously invisible anywhere on an Appointment, only ever
reachable via a join back to Lead nobody was doing. Deliberately NOT
added to the shared APPOINTMENT_SELECT constant in appointmentService.js
— that same constant backs the paginated Appointments list and the
claim-pool candidate query, and a Broker browsing appointments to claim
has no business seeing a Lead's ID number or insurance history before
claiming it. getAppointmentById() runs a second, detail-only query
instead, scoping the wider exposure to exactly the one view Mark asked
for.

FULL DATA EXPORT: new dataExportService.js (org-scoped queries across
Leads/Appointments/MeetingAttempts/CallAttempts + XLSX/JSON builders)
and dataExportHandlers.js (Admin/GlobalAdmin only), routed through the
existing flags-router.js (GET /api/flags/data-export) — the current live
deployment is still on Hobby's 12/12 function ceiling, so this is a
routing/packaging decision only, not a scaled-down design; the query and
file-generation logic itself targets Vercel's actual current defaults
(300s maxDuration under fluid compute, on by default on every tier),
not the old 10s Hobby figure this file mistakenly cited earlier in this
same session before being corrected. New feature flag
data.export.enabled (Operational, off by default) gates the new App
Admin "Data Export" tab — role is the real security boundary either
way, same pattern as every other flag-gated tab in this app. ID numbers
are MASKED in the export (last 4 digits only) — deliberately narrower
than the in-app plaintext views above, since a downloadable file is a
different risk profile than an access-controlled screen. This needs the
updated feature-flags.postgres.sql re-run against Neon before the flag
exists live — safe to do, confirmed ON CONFLICT (flagKey) DO NOTHING
already guards every other row in that file from being touched twice.

VERIFICATION: all four new/modified raw SQL queries actually run
against a real local Postgres 16 instance loaded from the live
schema.postgres.sql (not just read) — installed fresh in-session
specifically for this, per this project's own standing rule that SQL
correctness doesn't survive on inspection alone. Real foreign-keyed
seed data (using the schema's own pre-seeded Organisation/Portfolio/
Product rows, not invented ones) exercised every join. A second pass
ran the actual toSheetRows/XLSX-building logic from dataExportService.js
against the real row shapes node-postgres returns (confirmed: array
columns arrive as real JS arrays, DATE/TIMESTAMPTZ columns as real Date
objects — both handled correctly). Clean npm run build, 48/48 vitest,
function count unchanged at 12/12, diffed clean against a fresh
hydration — exactly the 12 files intended, nothing else touched.
Delivered as medbroker-idnumber-parity-export-20260819-0530.zip.

MID-SESSION CORRECTION WORTH RECORDING: this file's own effort-estimate
draft earlier in the same session had architected the export feature
around Vercel Hobby's old 10-second default duration and its 12-function
ceiling as if they were permanent constraints. Mark's pushback was
correct — Hobby's ToS explicitly prohibits commercial use, Pro is
already this project's own accepted target state, and Vercel's actual
current default (fluid compute, on by default on every tier) is 300s,
not 10s. The 12-function ceiling genuinely is Hobby-only and doesn't
apply on Pro at all. Corrected before building anything: the export's
business logic targets real current Vercel defaults; only the routing
decision (fold into flags-router.js vs. a dedicated function) stayed
Hobby-shaped, because that one is a real, current deployability fact
for whatever's live today, not a design constraint being carried
forward out of habit.

OUTSTANDING (unchanged from CURRENT STATE further up in this file):

0. COMPLIANCE-CRITICAL, added 20 Aug 2026 (full gap analysis in
   Project_Context_Vercel.md §12a) — close before commercial go-live,
   client is picking this project back up Feb 2027:
   a. CLOSED 20 Aug 2026, same session — Lead erasure/anonymisation
      capability built: true-erasure and restrict-and-retain paths
      (leadService.js), orchestrated via a new requestType
      (Access|Deletion) on the SAR model and executeSarDeletion()
      (sarService.js). Full detail in the session entry above. Still
      open as a separate follow-up: the scheduled purge job for a
      restricted Lead once its retentionExpiresAt actually lapses —
      see Project_Context_Vercel.md §12a's "STILL OPEN" note.
   b. CLOSED — confirmed by the 22 Aug 2026 independent security audit
      (§192) against the live code: field-level encryption already
      extended to all five (medicalAid/medicalAidProvider/
      existingCover/currentInsurer/policies), not idNumber alone. This
      line had gone stale; the extension itself happened in an earlier
      session (§12a) without this OUTSTANDING entry being updated to
      match — corrected here rather than left contradicting the code.
   c. CLOSED — same audit, same correction: vercel.json already carries
      a full header set (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options,
      X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy), not just
      Cache-Control on /assets. This line was equally stale.
   d. Confirm Neon's provisioning region; cross-border transfer
      assessment if not South Africa.
   e. Operator agreements: Vercel, Neon, Paystack, SMTP provider.
   f. Breach-notification process; Information Officer registered.
   g. Formal per-record-type data retention schedule (FAIS 5-year floor
      vs. POPIA's default "no longer than necessary").
   h. Enable security.kmsEncryption.enabled + configure AWS KMS for the
      actual client production deployment before go-live — currently
      off by default; DEMO_ENCRYPTION_KEY (unrotated env var) is what's
      actually protecting idNumber until this is switched on.
   i. Reformat MedBroker-User-Guide.docx and MedBroker-GlobalAdmin-
      Guide.docx as genuine OOXML .docx files — both are currently
      plain UTF-8 text saved with a .docx extension (same defect
      MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx had before it was
      corrected earlier this session). Not compliance-critical, but a
      real quality gap now that both are checked into the repo proper.

1. Vercel Pro upgrade — still an open business decision, required
   before commercial launch (higher function-count ceiling, Vercel's
   own rate-limiting tier). Development has stayed on Hobby by design;
   this is the separate, later commercial-launch threshold.

2. Dev-tooling, lowest priority, zero production exposure: ESLint v10 +
   the still-missing eslint.config.js (lint cannot run at all right
   now), and the Vite v8 / Vitest v4 major version bumps.

3. Settings -> photo upload — still an honest "coming soon" disabled
   stub, deliberately parked. Not a bug, not forgotten — Mark's own call
   not to take on a paid Vercel Blob dependency without a customer
   actually asking for it.

4. UI staleness / notification gap after a broker claims an appointment
   — the agent does get notified on a successful claim (confirmed in
   code), but whether the claiming broker's own list view refreshes
   without a manual reload is still unconfirmed either way.

5. A process gap worth naming directly, since it's what necessitated
   part of the 18 Aug 2026 update: real, substantial work (the Reports
   donut redesign, §179-191) happened across at least one session that
   never appended its own entries to this log — the only surviving
   record was dated code comments. Project_Context_Vercel.md stayed
   current throughout because whatever session did the work updated it
   directly; this file didn't get the same treatment. Worth treating as
   a live risk, not a one-off: if a session does substantive work,
   log it here before the session ends, even in brief — a
   correct-but-undocumented change is functionally invisible to the
   next session reading this file "first."

CLOSED, 19 Aug 2026 (third fix, same day): phantom "Lead details
updated" Change Log entries — a real, pre-existing gap this session's
Appointment editing feature exposed, not something it broke. Root
cause, verified by reading the actual live code rather than trusting
memory: leadHandlers.js's PUT /leads/:id handler has ALWAYS written a
'LeadUpdated' audit entry unconditionally after every successful save —
no `if (changeDetail has keys)` guard, ever. Harmless while the only
caller was LeadDetail.jsx's own edit form, where saving with nothing
touched is a rare edge case. AppointmentDetail.jsx's new "Edit Details"
(this same day) made it common instead of rare: that form always
resends the FULL current Lead-owned field set on every save, not just
whatever was actually touched — so saving a pure Appointment field like
the meeting link, with zero Lead fields changed, produced a genuine
write with an empty changeDetail every single time. describeEntry()
(AuditLogList.jsx) falls back to the bare "Lead details updated" label
for exactly this shape of entry — {} is truthy, so its own `if
(!detail) return label` check never caught it either.

CORRECTION TO THIS SAME DAY'S EARLIER ENTRY: the note claiming the new
Appointment PUT handler's audit-diffing "mirrors leadHandlers.js's
exact pattern" was based on a misreading of code read several turns
earlier, not on checking the actual file at the time. The new handler
was built correctly (gated) from the start; the OLD handler was the one
missing the gate, not the other way around. Fixed now: leadHandlers.js
gets the same `if (Object.keys(changeDetail).length > 0)` guard the
Appointment handler already had. Also checked and ruled out a second
hypothesis before settling on this one: idNumber's encryption is
genuinely non-deterministic (random IV per call, confirmed by reading
encryption.js), so re-encrypting an unchanged idNumber on every save
does waste a redundant encrypt() call — but the AUDIT DIFF compares
already-decrypted plaintext on both sides (existing.idNumber, via
getLeadById()'s own decryption), never the raw ciphertext, so that
specific mechanism was never actually the cause here. Left alone —
real but harmless inefficiency, not a bug, not worth added complexity
to avoid.

VERIFICATION: build clean, 48/48 vitest, gate logic smoke-tested
directly against the exact empty-changeDetail scenario from Mark's
screenshot. Diffed clean against a fresh hydration — exactly 1 file
touched (leadHandlers.js). Delivered as
medbroker-leadupdated-gate-fix-20260819-1735.zip.

CLOSED, 19 Aug 2026 (later same day): two bugs Mark caught live-testing
the Appointment editing feature above, both in the Change Log path
specifically — root-caused and fixed from a single screenshot, no
guessing.

BUG 1 — AppointmentUpdated entries showed no diff at all, just the bare
action name, while the LeadUpdated entry right below it (same save,
same timestamp) correctly showed "idNumber: — → ...; WhatsApp: — → ...".
Root cause: AuditLogList.jsx's describeEntry() has a dedicated
formatting case for 'LeadUpdated' (turns changeDetail into "field: from
→ to" text) but had no equivalent case for 'AppointmentUpdated' — a
brand new action name this same day's earlier session introduced. The
WRITE side was correct from the start (verified against real Postgres
before that delivery); this was purely a display gap in a completely
different file, the same shape of miss as the FLAG_META gap earlier
this session — new backend capability shipped, a corresponding frontend
piece in an unrelated file never got the matching update. Fixed: added
the 'AppointmentUpdated' case to describeEntry(), identical formatting
to 'LeadUpdated', plus FIELD_LABELS entries for the six Appointment-
native field names (Current insurer, Meeting type, Appointment date/
time, Address, Meeting link) so they render as words, not raw
camelCase.

BUG 2 — found proactively while fixing Bug 1, before it could produce a
confusing phantom diff once the display actually started working:
firstAppointmentTime is a Postgres TIME column, confirmed this session
(and earlier this same day, independently) to come back from the driver
as "14:30:00" (HH:mm:ss, a plain string) — but a native <input
type="time"> with no step attribute normalises to "14:30" (HH:mm). The
existing diff comparison used strict !==, so this field would have
registered as "changed" on literally every save touching any Appointment
field, even when the time was never touched — exactly the same class of
bug dateOfBirth already needed Date-vs-string handling for. Fixed:
both sides sliced to HH:mm before comparing, in the diff loop
specifically (the write itself was never the problem — Postgres accepts
"14:30" as TIME input and pads it internally, so nothing needed to
change there).

VERIFICATION: both fixes smoke-tested directly (the describeEntry
formatting logic run standalone against a real changeDetail shape; the
time-normalisation confirmed "14:30:00".slice(0,5) === "14:30".slice(0,5)).
npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest. Diffed clean against a fresh
hydration — exactly 2 files touched (appointmentHandlers.js,
AuditLogList.jsx). Delivered as
medbroker-changelog-fixes-20260819-1715.zip.

CLOSED, 19 Aug 2026: Supervisor+/Admin+ can now edit Appointment detail
fields — both Lead-owned (Personal Details/Education/Insurance
Information, plus Occupation/Mobile on the pre-existing Lead Details
card) and Appointment-native (current insurer, meeting type, date/time,
address/link) — with a merged, from/to Change Log covering both.

ROOT CAUSE THIS WAS BUILT ON: the Lead "converted and locked" rule
(leadHandlers.js) blocked ALL Lead edits — via LeadDetail.jsx AND the
read-only Appointment cards built 18 Aug — the moment a Lead had an
Appointment, which is essentially always. Not a bug in the 18 Aug work;
a pre-existing gap that work exposed. Fixed by relaxing the lock at the
ROLE level, not the field level: Supervisor/Admin/GlobalAdmin can now
edit through PUT /leads/:id while converted; Agent stays fully blocked,
matching Leads' own existing edit boundary. Safe because
UPDATE_LEAD_COLUMNS never contained pipeline fields (pipelineStatus,
assignedAgentId) to begin with — only ever detail fields — so there was
no pipeline-state field for a relaxed lock to accidentally expose.

APPOINTMENT-NATIVE FIELDS: brand new capability — updateAppointment() +
UPDATE_APPOINTMENT_COLUMNS (appointmentService.js), UpdateAppointmentSchema
(models/appointment.js), and PUT support added to the existing
handleAppointmentById (appointmentHandlers.js) — completing an endpoint
the frontend already half-expected: appointmentsApi.update() existed in
api.js calling PUT /appointments/:id, but nothing implemented it
server-side and nothing called it, confirmed by grep before building
anything new. Editable: currentInsurer, meetingType,
firstAppointmentDate/Time, firstAppointmentAddress, virtualMeetingLink.
Deliberately NOT region, despite living in the same table — explicitly
documented in schema.postgres.sql as a denormalised copy of Lead.region
captured at booking time for claim-model query performance, not an
independently editable fact; exposing it here would silently desync it
from the Lead it was copied from. Also NOT status/broker/agent/
portfolio — already governed by dedicated assign/reassign/claim/return
endpoints; a generic editor touching them here would open a second,
uncoordinated path to the same state changes.

CHANGE LOG, MERGED: new listAuditLogForAppointment(appointmentId, leadId)
(auditService.js) mirrors the existing listAuditLogForLead's UNION ALL
pattern exactly. Needed because editing the Lead-owned fields from the
Appointment page correctly writes an AuditLog entry with
entityType='Lead' (same leadHandlers.js code path LeadDetail.jsx's own
edits already use, completely unchanged) — but someone looking at the
Change Log ON the Appointment page, having just made that edit from
that exact page, should see it reflected right there. Verified against
real Postgres: inserted one Appointment-entity entry and one Lead-entity
entry, confirmed the merged query returns both, correctly sorted.
From/to diffing on the Appointment side mirrors leadHandlers.js's
pattern exactly, including the same Date-vs-string normalising
dateOfBirth already needed.

TWO BUGS CAUGHT AND FIXED DURING BUILD, BEFORE SHIPPING — worth naming
since this is exactly the "verified delivery over claimed delivery"
principle earning its keep, not just a formality:
  1. updateAppointment() initially checked a `result.rowCount` that
     doesn't exist on this codebase's executeQuery() return shape (it
     returns the row array directly, matching Neon's driver — a `pg`
     package assumption bleeding in from the earlier real-Postgres
     testing setup in this same session, not this codebase's actual
     shape). Fixed to match updateLead()'s own existing convention.
  2. The audit-diffing code in the new PUT handler initially referenced
     appt.firstDate/appt.address — AppointmentDetail.jsx's OWN
     client-side state aliases, not what the service layer actually
     returns. getAppointmentById() returns the real column names
     (firstAppointmentDate, firstAppointmentAddress) directly. Caught
     by checking APPOINTMENT_SELECT's actual column aliases rather than
     assuming the frontend's naming applied server-side too.

VERIFICATION: npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest, all five touched
backend files node --check clean. Real Postgres 16 (same instance from
earlier this session): ran the exact UPDATE_APPOINTMENT_COLUMNS-shaped
query against real seed data (confirmed all six fields wrote and read
back correctly); confirmed the target Lead was genuinely in
AppointmentScheduled status before running the exact UPDATE_LEAD_COLUMNS
query the relaxed lock allows through; ran the merged audit-log UNION
ALL query with real inserted entries of both entity types. Diffed
clean against a fresh hydration — exactly 6 files touched
(appointmentHandlers.js, leadHandlers.js, models/appointment.js,
appointmentService.js, auditService.js, AppointmentDetail.jsx), nothing
else. Delivered as medbroker-appointment-editing-20260819-1330.zip.

CLOSED, 19 Aug 2026: two follow-ups from Mark's live testing of the
18-19 Aug data export / ID number / field parity delivery.

FLAG_META GAP — genuine miss, root-caused. Mark ran the updated
feature-flags.postgres.sql against Neon exactly as instructed, but the
new data.export.enabled flag never appeared on the Feature Flags
settings page at all — no toggle, nothing to switch on. Root cause:
FeatureFlags.jsx's settings UI does NOT read its list of togglable
flags from the database — it renders from a hardcoded FLAG_META array
in that same file, meant to mirror the seed data (the file's own header
comment says so, and even flags GET /api/flags/meta as the eventual
"real" source, which doesn't exist yet). The 18 Aug session added the
new flag to the seed file — which correctly drives the actual flag()
gating logic everywhere else in the app via listFlags() — but never
added the matching FLAG_META entry, so the settings page had nothing to
render regardless of what the database said. This was a real gap in
that session's own verification, not anything Mark did wrong: the
gating logic was checked, the render path for the settings page itself
never was. Fixed: FLAG_META entry added (FeatureFlags.jsx), matching
the seed file's label/description/tier exactly. Also added
data.export.enabled to FlagContext.jsx's DEFAULT_FLAGS while in the
same file family, closing the earlier-flagged minor gap there too.

"CONTACT DETAILS" RENAMED TO "PERSONAL DETAILS" — Mark's request,
LeadDetail.jsx and AppointmentDetail.jsx both (parity preserved). The
card holds Date of Birth, ID Number, WhatsApp, and Hospital/Practice
(LeadDetail.jsx also Email/Mobile/Job Title) — a "Contact Details"
label stopped making sense once ID Number joined it 18 Aug, particularly
for a section holding sensitive identity data. "Personal Details" is
the locally-idiomatic SA-forms heading for exactly this mix (identity +
contact info together) — no fields moved, label only.

VERIFICATION: npm run build clean, 48/48 vitest, grep-confirmed no
remaining "Contact Details" UI references (only historical comments,
correctly left referencing the old name for context). Delivered as
medbroker-flagmeta-personaldetails-20260819-0600.zip, including
Status_Vercel.md at its correct repo-root path per the corrected memory
rule (memory edit #3) — first delivery since Mark caught it missing.

CLOSED, 18 Aug 2026: architecture diagrams (MedBroker-Architecture-
Overview.html). Mark uploaded the actual file — it was never missing
from the deployment, only from this project's knowledge. Lead Pipeline
and Appointments/Token Economy ERDs regenerated via Mermaid (matched to
the existing Midnight theme) to add LeadProduct and MeetingAttempt;
table count corrected 31 -> 33 in the two live-text mentions. The
system architecture diagram's "31 tables" label is baked into a
flattened image and was deliberately left alone rather than
regenerating a whole diagram from scratch for one stale word — flagged,
not silently ignored.

CURRENT SECURITY / DEPENDENCY STATE (verified 18 Aug 2026 against a
fresh hydration):
  - react-router: 7.18.2. Open-redirect + SSR-hydration CVEs closed. One
    remaining npm audit entry (RSC Mode CSRF Bypass) confirmed NOT
    applicable — no RSC usage anywhere in this app. Real fix is v8, a
    separate future decision.
  - xlsx: CLOSED. "npm:@e965/xlsx@^0.20.3" in package.json, confirmed on
    this hydration — CVE-2023-30533 and CVE-2024-22363 both closed.
  - engines.node: pinned to "24.x" (current Active LTS, supported
    through April 2028).
  - WAF: Vercel's own built-in Firewall, included on every plan. See
    Project_Context_Vercel.md §12 for the full decision.
  - DB connection TLS: db.js sets ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } —
    encrypts the connection to Neon but doesn't verify Neon's
    certificate. Low practical risk, tracked, not urgent.
  - Lead.idNumber field-level encryption: KMS-hardened. Requires
    KMS_MASTER_KEY_ID/AWS_REGION/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    all set before deploying.
  - Session token storage: httpOnly cookie (mb_session), SameSite=Strict,
    Secure hardcoded on.
  - Browser security headers: CORRECTED 22 Aug 2026 (§192) — this line
    previously read "No CSP header configured," which was stale by the
    time it was written, not current fact. vercel.json carries a full
    set (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options,
    Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) — confirmed directly against
    the live file during the independent security audit, not assumed
    from this note's own prior wording.
  - CSV/formula injection (F-02, §192): CLOSED. toCsv() now escapes a
    leading =/+/-/@ before writing a cell (api-lib/http/helpers.js).
  - Broker claim-pool PII exposure (F-01, §192): CLOSED.
    listAvailableToClaim() no longer returns Lead email/mobile pre-claim
    (api-lib/services/appointmentService.js).
  - Still queued, lowest priority: ESLint v10 + eslint.config.js; Vite
    v8 + Vitest v4 major bump.

VERCEL FUNCTION COUNT: exactly 12/12 (Hobby's hard ceiling), zero
headroom. Check the real count before adding any new top-level API
surface — `find frontend/api -type f -name "*.js" | wc -l`.
system-config.js folding into flags-router.js is the natural next
consolidation if/when headroom is needed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PERMANENT PATTERNS worth re-reading before touching adjacent code
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  - GlobalAdmin missing from requireRole() allow-lists is a recurring
    real bug on new routes — check every new route explicitly includes it.
  - Empty-string optional fields break Zod .optional() — apply a
    stripEmpty()-style helper to new create/update payloads.
  - HTML datetime-local inputs need z.string().datetime({ local: true }).
  - Client hides, server enforces — every permission/lock boundary in
    this app follows this split; new gates should too.
  - Backend date serialization: .toISOString().slice(0, 10) on a raw pg
    Date object, never String(dateObj).slice(0, 10) — see Project_
    Context_Vercel.md's CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES for the full story.
  - When something gets built, go back and correct every stale "not
    built yet" claim about it, not just the newest summary — a
    disclaimer alone didn't stop this exact confusion happening
    multiple times, including in this file's own §0 block above.
  - Text input font-size must stay >= 16px (1rem) — iOS Safari
    auto-zooms below that and doesn't zoom back out. Any new form
    control that doesn't route through tokens.js's shared formInput
    style needs this checked explicitly.
  - GROUP BY on computed columns joining Appointment and Lead must alias
    to `groupKey`, never a human-readable name that may collide with a
    real column — a real bug (§181), not a hypothetical.
  - `ReturnedToLeads` must never be counted as Lost anywhere in
    reporting — a standing invariant, re-affirmed at its actual query
    source in §185 after an earlier patch missed it downstream.
  - New DonutBreakdown cards must be true flex siblings within their
    row container, never separately-wrapped blocks, and must use shared
    s.card/s.metricCard tokens (colors.line/radius.md/shadow.sm), not
    one-off values — see Project_Context_Vercel.md's "Donut pattern"
    for the full current design.
  - SESSION-ISOLATION FOOTGUN: sessionStorage is per-tab but the
    mb_session cookie is shared across tabs — apparent "wrong user"
    bugs during multi-tab testing are frequently this, not a code
    defect. Ask whether multiple tabs/windows were open before
    accepting a live-testing report as evidence of a real bug.
