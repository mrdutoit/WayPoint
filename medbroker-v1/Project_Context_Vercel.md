MedBroker — Project Context (VERCEL VERSION)
==================================================
Scope: this file describes ONLY the Vercel + Neon Postgres deployment of
MedBroker — the version actually built, deployed, and tested every
session since 21 July 2026. It does not cover the separate Azure
Functions / Azure SQL production-target codebase (api/src/, infra/) that
predates this pivot — that work is frozen, tracked in the original
(pre-30 Jul 2026) Project_Context.md/Status.md, and out of scope for this
project going forward per Mark's direction (30 Jul 2026): a separate
Claude project will be started for any future Azure customer build.
Read this file alongside Status_Vercel.md — that one has current build
state and full session history; this one is architecture and standing
conventions.

PROJECT DOCUMENTS, added 20 Aug 2026: this repo now has a docs/ folder
holding the formal deliverables that used to live only in project
knowledge and were never actually part of the codebase — a gap
discovered when Mark asked to update "the Technical Specification" and
it turned out no such file had ever reached GitHub.
  docs/technical/MedBroker_Technical_Specification.docx — architecture,
    data model (6 diagrams, generated from the live schema, not
    approximated), security design, POPIA/FAIS compliance.
  docs/security/MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx — the
    living security audit record, updated each review session.
  docs/guides/MedBroker-User-Guide.docx, MedBroker-GlobalAdmin-Guide.docx
    — end-user and deployment/provisioning references. Known issue,
    not yet fixed: both are plain UTF-8 text saved with a .docx
    extension, not real OOXML packages — see Status_Vercel.md's
    Outstanding item 0i.
Going forward, any new formal document deliverable belongs in this
docs/ tree from the point it's first built, not left to live only in
project knowledge until someone notices it never made it into the repo.

1. WHAT THE SYSTEM IS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MedBroker — a FAIS/POPIA-compliant lead management and broker-matching
platform for a South African medical insurance brokerage. ~50 users
across five roles (GlobalAdmin, Admin, Supervisor, Agent, Broker). Leads
come in, get worked by Agents through a call pipeline, convert into
Appointments, get matched to Brokers, and the Broker records the meeting
outcome (products sold, won/lost). Tasks and Notifications generate
automatically off real events in that pipeline. A public-facing Lead
Portal lets prospects self-register and check in to events without staff
involvement.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Frontend       React 18 (Vite) — client-side SPA, no SSR
  Hosting        Vercel — Root Directory: medbroker-v1/frontend
  Backend API    Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js), one file per
                 domain under frontend/api/, each a thin router
                 delegating to frontend/api-lib/ (handlers -> services)
  Database       Neon Postgres (serverless Postgres)
  Auth           Local email/password, JWT (HS256), 8-hour expiry —
                 signJwt()/verifyJwt() in api-lib/services/authService.js.
                 No refresh-token flow or explicit revocation exists yet
                 (§ below, SECURITY POSTURE).
  Routing        react-router v7 (declarative mode — BrowserRouter/
                 Routes/Route, no data loaders/actions/RSC)
  Edge security  Vercel Firewall (WAF) — built into the platform itself,
                 not a separate vendor. See SECURITY POSTURE.
  Repository     GitHub -> mrdutoit/MedBroker (public)
                 Folder structure: medbroker-v1/ at repo root
  Deploy         github.dev drag-and-drop upload (Mark has no local CLI
                 on his usual work PC) -> Vercel auto-deploys on push to
                 main. A GitHub Codespace was used once (28 Jul 2026) for
                 an npm-install-from-a-non-registry-source task; not the
                 normal workflow.

NOT part of this stack (was the ORIGINAL plan, superseded 21-22 July
2026, now tracked separately): Azure Functions, Azure SQL, Azure Entra
ID/MSAL, Azure Blob Storage, Bicep, Microsoft 365 Graph API, Calendly,
Zoho. None of these are integrated into the Vercel version. If asked
about any of them, the honest answer is "not part of this build."

THIRD PARTIES actually in play for this version: Vercel (hosting +
edge/WAF), Neon (database), Stripe (token purchase checkout/webhook,
§134, 6 Aug 2026 — only when appointments.tokens.paymentProvider =
'stripe'; not usable for this specific deployment since Stripe doesn't
support South African merchants), Paystack (same, §135, 7 Aug 2026,
only when the flag = 'paystack' — this is the one actually usable in
South Africa), and whichever SMTP provider is configured for email
notifications (Resend by default — see emailService.js). That's the
operator/sub-processor list that actually matters for this deployment
— see SECURITY POSTURE and POPIA / THIRD PARTIES below.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3. ROLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

GlobalAdmin   Internal staff only — never assigned to customers.
              Sees Feature Flags page. Configures feature flags per deployment.

Admin         Customer-facing administrator. Manages users, portfolios,
              subscriptions, system settings. Assigns/reassigns leads and
              appointments. Cannot see Feature Flags.

Supervisor    Manages direct reports (agents and brokers). Sees only leads,
              appointments, tasks, etc. belonging to their direct reports
              (+ their own). Server-enforced everywhere this matters, not
              just a frontend filter — see CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES.

Agent         Calls leads, logs call outcomes, books appointments.
              Sees only leads/tasks assigned to them. Never sees Appointments list.

Broker        Attends appointments. Records meeting outcomes.
              In assign model: sees appointments assigned to them.
              In claim model: sees My Appointments tab + Available to Claim tab.

Demo-mode role switcher: none — role comes from the real logged-in user
(RoleContext.jsx derives it from AuthContext's user object). CORRECTED
§121 (4 Aug 2026) — this paragraph used to describe a "PERSONAS-based
preview role switcher" and "apiMode.DEMO_MODE" as if both still existed;
neither does. The preview switcher was removed entirely 1 Aug 2026 (§87);
apiMode/DEMO_MODE/ENTRA_MODE (a dead, pre-§114 parallel auth scheme —
see api.js's own header) were removed 4 Aug 2026 as part of SSO stage 4
(§120). Role has been derived from the real authenticated user, local or
SSO, this whole time regardless of what this paragraph claimed.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4. DATA MODEL — KEY ENTITIES AND STATUS SETS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Schema of record: frontend/db/schema.postgres.sql (+ frontend/db/
migrations/*.sql for incremental changes — Mark runs these against Neon
by hand; Claude has no live DB access from the sandbox, ever).

Lead
  pipelineStatus: Unassigned | Assigned | InProgress | AppointmentScheduled
                  | Closed
  Corrected 14 Aug 2026 (§166) — this line previously said "ClosedLost",
  which was never a real value (checked the actual CK_Lead_Status
  constraint directly: the fifth value has always been 'Closed'). Set in
  two places: leadService.js's call-outcome-close path (a lead closed
  via a direct call outcome, never reached an appointment), and — new,
  §166 — appointmentService.saveOutcome(), the moment an Appointment
  closes ClosedWon or ClosedLost, GUARDED against another still-open
  Appointment for the same Lead. Before §166 this second path didn't
  exist at all — a lead whose deal was genuinely finished stayed
  permanently stuck at whatever status it last held, the specific bug
  Mark found while testing.
  One Lead can have MANY Appointment rows over its lifetime (one-to-many
  since a 23 Jul 2026 schema change) — a failed attempt, a Reopen, and a
  second attempt all leave separate rows, preserved as history.
  Special/sensitive fields (idNumber) are field-level encrypted
  (AES-256-GCM) with a blind-index hash column for exact-match lookups
  without decrypting (encryption.js).
  Portfolio and Products are both many-to-many (LeadPortfolio,
  LeadProduct — migration 028, 14 Aug 2026, §157/§158/§159) — a Lead can
  declare interest across more than one of each, mirroring
  UserPortfolio/BrokerProduct. Both mandatory on the manual "Create Lead"
  form specifically (leadSource === 'ManualEntry'), exempt on CSV/
  subscription bulk import; both editable afterward on LeadDetail.jsx;
  both pre-fill into Book Appointment, still fully editable there. Products
  is scoped to whichever portfolio(s) are currently selected (same
  dependent-selection shape Book Appointment already used for its own
  product picker) — there is no Lead-level product list independent of
  portfolio.
  region (migration 032, 14 Aug 2026, §166): nullable VARCHAR(50), one
  of the nine SA provinces (REGIONS, leadOptions.js). Mandatory on
  manual Create Lead only, same split as Portfolio/Products. No
  backfill for existing leads — same "don't invent a field with no
  home" reasoning throughout this session. Carried onto Appointment.region
  at booking time; what assignLead() (leadService.js) checks the target
  Agent's own region against, rejecting a cross-region assignment when
  both are set and genuinely differ (lenient, not strict, when either
  side is unset); what claim-model broker matching
  (listAvailableToClaim, appointmentService.js) reads first now, falling
  back to the Appointment's own Agent's region only for pre-migration
  appointments that never had a Lead.region to carry forward. Full
  account of the architectural finding underneath this (region was
  ALREADY captured, but only ephemerally, in Book Appointment's own
  broker-search dropdown, never persisted) lives in Status_Vercel.md
  §166.

Appointment
  status: Unassigned | Assigned | InProgress | ClosedWon | ClosedLost |
          ReturnedToLeads | Claimed
  Child of Lead. Won/Lost outcome (customerSigned) lives here, not on Lead.
  lostReason (§163, 14 Aug 2026, migration 030): nullable VARCHAR(50),
  CHECK-constrained to six fixed categories (PriceTooHigh/ChoseCompetitor/
  NoLongerInterested/Uncontactable/NotEligible/Other) — Claude's own
  design choice, not an exhaustive taxonomy. Captured in the same
  outcome-save flow as customerSigned = false (AppointmentDetail.jsx),
  not a separate action; the frontend blocks saving until one's picked,
  the Zod schema itself stays optional.
  claimModel flag switches between Admin/Supervisor-assigns-broker vs
  Broker-self-claims-from-a-queue (token economy attaches to claim mode
  specifically — see FEATURE FLAG SYSTEM). claimedByBrokerId/claimedAt/
  claimTokenCost are all real now (§117) — set by claimAppointment()
  (appointmentService.js) when a broker claims from the pool.
  region (migration 032, 14 Aug 2026, §166): nullable VARCHAR(50),
  carried straight from Lead.region at booking time (createAppointment(),
  appointmentService.js) — not independently editable, a copy for query
  convenience. This is what claim-model broker matching
  (listAvailableToClaim) reads first now, COALESCE-falling-back to the
  Appointment's own Agent's region only when this is null (a pre-
  migration appointment that never had a Lead.region to carry forward).
  See Lead's own region entry above for the fuller account.

MeetingAttempt (§138 spec, session 20; §164 build, 14 Aug 2026, migration
  031) — replaces the old flat meeting{1,2,3}Date/Status/Feedback columns
  on Appointment (still present on the table, deliberately NOT dropped —
  unused by application code, kept until the backfill is confirmed
  correct in production, a follow-up cleanup migration removes them
  later). Append-only, one row per ATTEMPT of a meeting number, matching
  CallAttempt's own established pattern exactly (organisationId,
  recordedById, createdAt as the natural ordering) — a reschedule creates
  a NEW row rather than editing the old one, so history is never
  silently overwritten the way it was before.
  meetingNumber: 1, 2, or 3 (3 only reachable when
  appointments.thirdMeeting.enabled is on).
  status: Scheduled (default, not yet decided) | HeldInterested |
  HeldNotInterested | Rescheduled | Cancelled | Missed. Cancelled/Missed
  added back 15 Aug 2026 (§172, migration 034) — REVERSES the 14 Aug
  decision (this same entry, one day earlier) to collapse them into
  Rescheduled. Mark's real-world case: a client cancelling or not
  showing, with no reschedule happening at that moment, is genuinely
  different from one being actively rebooked, worth reporting on
  separately — even though all three route IDENTICALLY at the mechanics
  level (a new row, same meeting number, no outcome form; "it's still
  the first meeting if a subsequent one gets set up," Mark's own
  framing). Migration 034 also RECOVERED the original Cancelled/
  Rescheduled distinction for data migration 031 had already collapsed —
  possible because the old flat meeting{1,2,3}Status columns were never
  dropped, so the source values were still there to recover from, not
  guessed at.
  cancelReason: nullable, only meaningful when status = 'Cancelled' —
  Missed has nothing to categorise (no communication happened by
  definition), so free-text `notes` is the only place to record context
  for a no-show. Structured, not free text, same reasoning as
  Appointment.lostReason.
  followUpRequired: nullable boolean, asked ONLY when status is saved as
  HeldInterested AND this isn't the last configured meeting number —
  resolved server-side (saveMeetingAttemptOutcome, appointmentService.js),
  never trusted from the client.
  Full routing table (this IS the redesign's actual logic, not just its
  schema) lives in saveMeetingAttemptOutcome()'s own header comment — see
  that function directly, or Status_Vercel.md §164/§172 for the build
  account, including two real bugs found during §164's own manual
  frontend review (neither caught by the build or test suite).
  status is now OPTIONAL on the save endpoint (SaveMeetingAttemptSchema)
  as of 16 Aug 2026 (§176) — a real gap Mark found: saving a row still
  required BOTH date and status together, so there was no way to record
  just a follow-up meeting's DATE without being forced to also record
  its OUTCOME before the meeting had even happened. Omitting status now
  saves the date only (recordedById, notes too) and leaves the row at
  'Scheduled', still open, still awaiting a real outcome later —
  handled as an early-return branch in saveMeetingAttemptOutcome(), not
  the four-branch routing table (which only ever applies once a real
  status is actually being recorded). recordedById doubles as the
  frontend's own signal for "has this row been touched since creation"
  (AppointmentDetail.jsx's isOriginalMeeting1Date, see below) — null
  only on the pristine row createAppointment() creates at booking time;
  every other row, including one that's only ever had its date saved,
  gets it stamped.

isOriginalMeeting1Date (AppointmentDetail.jsx, MeetingAttemptForm) — the
  signal for locking a meeting-1 row's date field, since only the
  original booking-time row's date should be immutable there. CHANGED
  16 Aug 2026 (§176) from `!!attempt.date` to `attempt.recordedById ===
  null` — the date-based check broke the moment a date-only save (above)
  became possible: saving just a date onto a rebooked meeting-1 row
  makes attempt.date truthy, which under the old check would have
  locked that same row right back up, reintroducing the exact bug §174
  had just fixed. recordedById is the more robust signal — true only
  for the row nobody has ever saved anything onto since createAppointment()
  created it.

Task
  type: Callback | Appointment | Reschedule | Reminder | Outcome | Manual
  entityType/entityId: nullable, polymorphic (Lead OR Appointment OR
  neither for a manually created task). Five system-generation rules,
  all event-driven (no scheduled job needed) — see Status_Vercel.md for
  exactly where each one hooks in. Cascade cleanup (reassign/delete) runs
  when the Lead/Appointment a task is about changes owner or closes out.
  createdById (§69): nullable, always NULL for system-generated tasks,
  always populated for manual ones. A creator's own tasks are always
  visible to them regardless of who they're assigned to — enforced via
  a single shared canSeeTask() helper (§71) used by both the list-view
  scoping and the single-task visibility check; these two used to be
  separate, drift-prone copies, which is exactly how a real visibility
  bug slipped through §69 (list view fixed, single-task check wasn't).

TaskComment (§71)
  taskId, authorId, body, createdAt. No edit/delete — a discussion
  thread is a record of what was said and when, not a document to
  revise (matches AuditLog's own philosophy). ON DELETE CASCADE on
  taskId. Visibility matches the parent Task's — whoever can see a task
  can read and post to its comment thread, no separate permission tier.

Notification
  type: LeadAssigned | AppointmentAssigned | AppointmentReminder |
        CallbackReminder | LeadAutoReturned | TaskAssigned |
        TaskDueReminder | AppointmentUnassignedWarning — eight now (this
        line was stale before 14 Aug 2026, §160 — missed TaskAssigned/
        TaskDueReminder, added §98, 3 Aug 2026; corrected here alongside
        adding the newest one rather than compounding the gap). First
        two/action-driven ones wired §61; TaskAssigned §98;
        AppointmentReminder/CallbackReminder/LeadAutoReturned/
        TaskDueReminder/AppointmentUnassignedWarning all run off the
        same daily Vercel Cron scan (schedulerService.js) — needs
        CRON_SECRET set in Vercel's env vars to actually fire, see
        Status_Vercel.md §68.
  Always self-scoped — recipientId = the viewer, full stop, no
  cross-user visibility the way Task's admin/supervisor scoping has.

User
  role: GlobalAdmin | Admin | Supervisor | Agent | Broker
  Local auth: passwordHash (NULL for an SSO-only user — real as of §114,
  4 Aug 2026: JIT-provisioned SSO users are created this way), passwordSetAt,
  passwordMustChange, failedLoginAttempts, isLocked.
  Entra SSO (§114, stage 1+2 — see Status_Vercel.md, entraAuthService.js):
  entraObjectId is the primary match key once linked; first-ever SSO login
  matches an existing local row by email and backfills entraObjectId onto
  it rather than creating a duplicate — every FK already pointing at that
  user's id (Lead.assignedAgentId, Appointment.brokerId, AuditLog.
  performedById, etc.) keeps working with no separate merge step. A
  genuinely new identity (no match by oid or email) is JIT-provisioned
  INACTIVE with role='Agent' — that's the review gate; a GlobalAdmin
  activates and sets the real role/portfolio/supervisor via User Admin,
  same surface PUT /api/users/:id/link-identity (GlobalAdmin-only email
  correction + manual identity link/unlink) uses. Stage 3 (password-
  fallback toggle + offboarding sync) and stage 4 (frontend MSAL wiring —
  the actual "Sign in with Microsoft" button) are NOT built yet; see
  Status_Vercel.md §0 NEXT ACTION.
  Password policy (§72, fully real): createUserFull() always sets
  passwordMustChange=true whenever a password is set at creation — a
  manually created user is always forced to set their own on first
  login. Rotation (SystemConfig.passwordRotationDays) and lockout
  (passwordLockoutAttempts) were already enforced at login before §72;
  what changed is they're now admin-configurable (AppAdmin -> System
  Settings), not just backend-enforced with no UI. Self-service and
  forced changes both go through PUT /api/auth/change-password.
  Self-service profile fields (added for Settings, §55-era work):
  themePreference, avatarColour, timezone — separate from admin-editable
  fields (role, portfolios, isActive) via a deliberately narrow
  self-service schema, never a permissive subset of the admin one.

PasswordHistory (§72)
  userId, passwordHash, createdAt. Every hash a user's password has ever
  held. Checked (via bcrypt verifyPassword() against each entry from the
  current calendar year, one at a time — hashes are one-way, no direct
  comparison possible) whenever a new password is set, if
  SystemConfig.passwordPreventReuse is on (default). ON DELETE CASCADE.

TokenLedger / TokenTransaction (§117, token economy)
  One TokenLedger row per Broker (balance = paid tokens, freeRemaining =
  this calendar month's free allocation, lazily reset on read — no cron
  in this stack). TokenTransaction is the append-only history (Credit/
  Debit), never edited. TokenTransaction.externalRef (§134, nullable,
  partial UNIQUE index WHERE NOT NULL) holds a Stripe Checkout Session id
  OR a Paystack transaction reference (§135) for a webhook-originated
  credit ONLY — provider-agnostic by design, this is the idempotency
  mechanism against either provider's documented at-least-once webhook
  redelivery: the guarded INSERT itself is the atomic check, not a
  read-then-write existence lookup. Both providers' webhook handlers call
  the same tokenService.creditPurchasedTokens() to apply it — that
  function was originally named creditStripeTokens() and generalized
  the moment a second provider needed the identical logic (§135), since
  it never actually inspected anything Stripe-specific in the first
  place. NULL for every other transaction type (claim debits, refunds,
  manual admin top-ups, §117).

IntegrationCredential (§134, 6 Aug 2026; extended §135, 7 Aug 2026)
  One row per (organisationId, provider), provider IN
  ('stripe','smtp','paystack'). The ENTIRE per-provider config is
  JSON-encoded and encrypted as a single opaque blob (encryptedConfig)
  via encryption.js's existing envelope encryption — the same
  'kms1'/'demo1' format-aware encrypt()/decrypt() pair Lead.idNumber
  already uses, so this inherits AWS-KMS-when-the-flag-is-on / demo1-
  when-it's-not for free. Deliberately NOT SystemConfig — that table's
  GET is open to any authenticated staff member by design; a payment
  provider secret key or SMTP password needs a different (GlobalAdmin-
  only, both directions) access model entirely. Read/written exclusively
  through api-lib/services/integrationCredentialService.js, which is
  also the ONLY place a decrypted config is ever produced (getRawConfig()
  — internal use only, by stripeService.js/paystackService.js/
  emailService.js; never returned from an HTTP handler). getMaskedStatus()
  is what any handler actually returns — secret fields become
  `<field>Set: boolean` + a last-4-characters preview, never the raw
  value, once saved. Not every provider has the same field shape — see
  integrationCredentialService.js's own SECRET_FIELDS map: stripe has
  two secret fields (secretKey, webhookSigningSecret), paystack has one
  (secretKey — Paystack reuses it for both API calls and webhook
  signing, no separate signing secret exists), smtp has one (password).

Organisation
  Multi-tenancy-ready, single-tenant today. resolveOrganisationId() in
  api-lib/context/tenant.js is the one chokepoint every query goes
  through — currently always returns the single seeded default org.
  Activating real multi-tenancy later is a change to that one function,
  not a rewrite of every query (already parameterised on organisationId
  throughout).

Managed via: Admin -> Feature Flags (GlobalAdmin only)
Database table: FeatureFlag (flagKey, label, valueType, value, tier, isPhase2)

  auth.sso.enabled                boolean  false  (real backend gate since §114, 4 Aug 2026 —

CLAIM MODEL flag (appointments.claimModel):

  'claim'  — Brokers self-select from an Available to Claim queue
             (region + product matched, same rule brokerMatchingService.js
             uses for the assign model's own matching); claiming is
             immediate (no admin confirmation step), and debits
             TokenLedger via tokenService.js. REAL as of §117 (4 Aug 2026)
             — was frontend-mock-only before that (see models/appointment.js's
             pre-§117 header if ever curious what the staging note used to
             say). appointments.tokens.paymentProvider has THREE real
             values now: 'stripe' (§134, 6 Aug 2026) — built, but not
             usable for this deployment since Stripe doesn't support
             South African merchants at all; 'paystack' (§135, 7 Aug
             2026, Stripe-owned, ZAR-native, South-Africa-supported) —
             the one actually usable here; and 'none' (§117, manual
             top-up by Admin/GlobalAdmin via UserAdmin.jsx's Token
             Balance section). All three are independent, coexisting
             funding rails, not a staged replacement of one by another
             — switching the flag doesn't remove any of them. Stripe and
             Paystack share almost everything underneath (raw-body
             webhook verification, TokenTransaction.externalRef
             idempotency, tokenService.creditPurchasedTokens()) — see
             Status_Vercel.md §134/§135 for the full build and
             verification of each.

8. CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THEME SYSTEM: 4 themes on a CSS-variable contract (themes.css). tokens.js
resolves everything to var(--whatever) so the design-token layer reskins
automatically — never hardcode a hex value in a component; use tokens.js
or a CSS variable directly.

tokens.js NAMED EXPORTS ONLY — never `import tokens from`. Always read
tokens.js before touching any component.

useRole() HOOK ONLY — never import the RoleContext object directly.

COLOR-MIX() IN JSX STYLE OBJECTS must always be a quoted string:
  Correct: background: 'color-mix(in srgb, #15803d 14%, var(--panel))'
  Wrong:   background: color-mix(in srgb, #15803d 14%, var(--panel))
  The unquoted form is a syntax error esbuild catches at build time.

SELECT ELEMENTS need explicit color: 'var(--ink)' — browser OS defaults
override theme colours on <select> without it. color-scheme is
theme-driven (set per [data-theme] block in themes.css), never set
inline on individual inputs — that makes native controls follow the OS's
light/dark preference instead of MedBroker's selected theme.

BACKEND DATE SERIALIZATION: the Postgres driver returns TIMESTAMPTZ/DATE
columns as native JS Date objects, not strings — still true after §137's
move from pg.Pool to @neondatabase/serverless's HTTP driver (12 Aug
2026): confirmed via the installed package's own source and its
documented guarantee that HTTP-driver results match its WebSocket Pool/
Client, which itself uses the same pg-types OID-to-parser mapping pg
does (DATE/TIMESTAMPTZ -> Date object). Not exercised against a live
Neon endpoint from this sandbox (no network path to neon.tech here), so
worth Mark spot-checking one date-bearing field for real post-deploy —
but this is not expected to have changed, and nothing in this rule's own
advice below changes either way. String(dateObj) calls .toString(), which
omits the year in a way that silently defaults to 2001 if ever re-parsed
via new Date(...) on the frontend (a real bug this cost — "Overdue
9129d" on a task due in 3 days). Always .toISOString().slice(0, 10) on a
raw Date object from a query result, never String(...).slice(0, 10).
Frontend code slicing a value already received via a JSON API response
is safe (JSON.stringify already calls .toISOString() on any Date object
crossing that boundary) — this only bites backend code serializing a raw
pg result directly.

GlobalAdmin MISSING FROM requireRole() ALLOW-LISTS is a recurring real
bug on new routes — check every new route explicitly includes it
alongside Admin.

EMPTY-STRING OPTIONAL FIELDS break Zod .optional() — apply a
stripEmpty()-style helper to new create/update payloads.

HTML datetime-local INPUTS need z.string().datetime({ local: true }) —
the default z.string().datetime() requires a timezone offset the input
never produces.

CLIENT HIDES, SERVER ENFORCES — every permission/lock boundary in this
app follows this split (Supervisor scoping, Lead edit-lock/Reopen,
Task's admin-vs-assignee split, etc.). Any new gate should too — never
trust a frontend-only check for anything that actually matters.

VERCEL FUNCTION COUNT: every file directly under frontend/api/ is a
separate serverless function on Vercel, REGARDLESS of what vercel.json's
rewrites do — a nested file (frontend/api/broker-matching/index.js) once
got missed in a count for exactly this reason. Hobby plan hard limit is
12. Currently sitting at exactly 12/12 — check the real count (`find
frontend/api -type f -name "*.js" | wc -l`) before adding any new
top-level API surface; system-config.js folding into flags-router.js is
the natural next consolidation if headroom is needed.

RAW-BODY ROUTES ON A SHARED VERCEL FUNCTION (§134, 6 Aug 2026) — a
function file's `export const config = { api: { bodyParser: false } }`
is FILE-WIDE, not per-route, because one file is one Vercel function
regardless of how many logical routes vercel.json's rewrite dispatches
to it (see VERCEL FUNCTION COUNT above — same underlying fact, different
consequence). appointments-router.js needed this for the Stripe webhook
(signature verification needs the exact raw bytes; re-serializing an
already-JSON-parsed body doesn't reliably round-trip byte-for-byte), but
five OTHER routes already living in that same file needed req.body to
stay a plain parsed object exactly as before. The fix, now the standing
pattern for this situation: disable bodyParser file-wide, read the raw
stream once via readRawBody() (http/helpers.js) before dispatching, and
for every route except the one that genuinely needs raw bytes,
immediately JSON.parse the raw buffer into req.body — reproducing
exactly what Vercel's automatic parser used to do, so none of those
other routes' handlers need to know this ever happened. If a future
raw-body need (another webhook, a file upload, etc.) lands in a
different existing router file, follow this same shape rather than
re-deriving it — see appointments-router.js's own header comment for
the worked example.

CSV/EXCEL FORMULA INJECTION: any free-text field populated from an
externally-supplied file (bulk lead import) gets a leading-quote prefix
if it starts with =, +, -, or @ (neutralizeFormulaInjection() in
leadService.js's createLead(), applied unconditionally — manual entry
too). Closed 28 Jul 2026; don't reintroduce a raw-write path that skips it.

FEATURE FLAGS, TWO DIFFERENT ENFORCEMENT PATTERNS — know which one a new
flag needs before building it. Most flags (tasks.enabled,
popia.subjectAccessRequest.enabled) are frontend-visibility-only: they
gate a nav item/tab/route client-side via useFlags(), never re-checked
server-side, because the real security boundary for those features is
role (requireRole()), already enforced independently. A smaller set
(notifications.email.enabled, security.kmsEncryption.enabled, §112) gate
actual backend BEHAVIOUR — which code path runs, not just what's visible
— and those are read server-side via getFlagMeta() (services/
flagService.js), a live DB query, not the frontend's cached FlagContext
value. Don't assume a new flag only needs the frontend pattern just
because most existing ones use it — ask whether the flag is hiding a UI
element or actually changing what the server does, and pick accordingly.

STAFF SESSION AUTH: httpOnly cookie (mb_session), not a bearer token in
sessionStorage — changed 4 Aug 2026, §113. setAuthCookie()/
clearAuthCookie()/getAuthCookie() in http/helpers.js; every request from
the frontend needs credentials: 'same-origin' explicitly set for the
cookie to attach (services/api.js's request() and the two direct-fetch
export functions all do this — match that pattern for any new direct-
fetch call that bypasses request()). The permissive CORS Origin-
reflection in applyCors() is safe with this cookie in play ONLY because
of two things holding together: SameSite=Strict on the cookie, and
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials never being set to true. Don't loosen
either without re-examining CORS at the same time — see applyCors()'s
own comment for the full reasoning. Lead Portal auth (a structurally
separate JWT/cookie boundary, ProspectAuthContext) got the SAME
treatment as of §115 (4 Aug 2026) — its own httpOnly cookie
(mb_portal_session), its own setPortalAuthCookie()/clearPortalAuthCookie()/
getPortalAuthCookie() trio, deliberately not the staff functions
parameterised with a different name — see http/helpers.js for why. Both
cookies coexist safely in the same browser: separate names, separate
signing secrets (config.localAuth vs config.portalAuth), same SameSite=
Strict/no-credentials-header CORS reasoning applying to both.

MANAGED KEY/SECRET SERVICES ON THIS STACK: AWS KMS, not a self-hosted
option (Vault, etc.) — chosen 4 Aug 2026 for encryption.js's field-level
encryption (§111/§112) specifically to avoid adding a standing service
to run and maintain; stays a managed API call, consistent with the
Vercel+Neon-only infrastructure philosophy elsewhere in this project.
Precedent for any future "we need real secret/key custody, not an env
var" need on this stack.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
9. TEST ACCOUNTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CORRECTED §121 (4 Aug 2026) — this section used to be titled "MOCK DATA —
PREVIEW PERSONAS" and described PERSONAS in RoleContext.jsx as "a
fallback for a theoretical Entra branch that was never actually wired to
a real identity source," with role/identity said to come from
"apiMode.DEMO_MODE." None of that has been true since 1 Aug 2026 (§87
removed the preview switcher) and 4 Aug 2026 (§114/§120 built and wired
real Entra SSO, and removed apiMode/DEMO_MODE entirely). What's left and
still genuinely true: these are real local-auth accounts used throughout
development, nothing more special than that. Test accounts used
throughout development: Chantelle Hattingh (Supervisor), Steve Madden
(Agent), Sandra van der Berg (Broker), Werner Hattingh (Admin).


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
10. TENANCY & DELIVERY MODEL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Model: single-tenant, multi-tenant-ready.
  organisationId is NOT NULL on every tenant-owned table, DEFAULT'd to a
  single seeded default org — single-tenant deployment sets nothing extra.
  resolveOrganisationId() (api-lib/context/tenant.js) is the one
  chokepoint every query resolves organisationId through. Activating
  real multi-tenancy later is a change to that one function's internals
  (resolve from validated token/host instead of a hardcoded default) —
  not a rewrite of the data layer, which is already parameterised on
  organisationId throughout (leadService, appointmentService, taskService,
  notificationService, eventService, brokerMatchingService — everything).
  NOT YET DONE if/when multi-tenancy actually activates: enable
  row-level security as the real enforcement boundary (today's DEFAULT
  constraint is a convenience, not a security control by itself);
  consolidate/plan instance DBs.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
11. DESIGN SYSTEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4 themes on a CSS-variable contract: linen (default, light), terra,
midnight, ember. Variables: --bg --panel --ink --mut --line --accent
--accent2 --live --limited --danger --glow. Theme choice is real and
persisted server-side (User.themePreference, PUT /api/users/me) for the
logged-in user, applied instantly on selection and again automatically
on a fresh login (AuthContext consumes ThemeContext for this specifically).


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
12. SECURITY POSTURE & MANDATORY CONTROLS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Rewritten 30 Jul 2026 for the Vercel-only scope of this project. The
control CATEGORIES below are unchanged from general security practice;
what changed is which specific technology answers each one, since this
build was never actually deployed on Azure.

EDGE / TRANSPORT
  WAF — DECISION CHANGED 30 Jul 2026: the original plan (Cloudflare Pro
    in front of an Azure origin, ~R400/mo) is void — there is no Azure
    origin. Use Vercel's own built-in Firewall instead:
      - Included on EVERY Vercel plan, including Hobby (free) — DDoS
        mitigation and Attack Mode are on by default, no configuration
        needed. IP blocking and Custom Rules are available immediately
        (Hobby: up to 3 rules each; Pro, $20/mo: up to 100 IP-block
        rules, up to 40 Custom Rules; Enterprise adds Managed Rulesets).
      - Rate limiting specifically is a Pro-plan-and-above feature, not
        included on Hobby — relevant to the still-open "rate limiting on
        authenticated endpoints" control below.
      - CONFIRMED 3 Aug 2026 (§100, checked against Vercel's current
        docs directly): rate limiting is NOT automatic on Pro. Being on
        the plan only makes it available to configure — someone must
        create a Custom Rule in the Firewall tab (or vercel.json / the
        @vercel/firewall SDK) specifying target paths, threshold,
        algorithm, and action. It's also a separately metered cost
        (~$0.50/million allowed requests), not bundled into the flat
        Pro subscription. Mark's decision: defer to this rather than
        build a custom Postgres-backed limiter, given the customer's
        real deployment will be on Pro — but the Custom Rule itself
        still needs to be configured against the customer's actual
        Vercel account before it does anything. See §100 for the
        specific endpoints to prioritise (the public,
        unauthenticated ones — staff/portal login, portal
        register/activate/walkin) and suggested starting thresholds.
      - Do NOT add Cloudflare in front of Vercel as well — per Vercel's
        own published guidance, running Cloudflare in proxy mode ahead of
        Vercel degrades client signals and creates two overlapping WAF
        layers in the same request path (Vercel's is already embedded at
        its own edge, not sitting behind a separate origin the way the
        Azure comparison assumed). One edge security layer, not two.
      - Configure via the Firewall tab in the Vercel dashboard, or
        vercel.json for rule-as-code. Not yet configured beyond the
        platform defaults — this is the standing action item, not
        something this delivery can complete on its own (it's a
        dashboard action against a real Vercel account, not a code
        change) — do this before go-live.
  ✅ Browser security headers — CLOSED 20 Aug 2026 (F3, security audit).
     vercel.json now sets CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-
     Options, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy on every route
     (a second headers-array entry, source "/(.*)", alongside the
     existing /assets Cache-Control rule — both apply cumulatively on
     asset responses, which is harmless).
       - style-src deliberately includes 'unsafe-inline': this app
         styles almost entirely via React's inline style={{}} prop —
         thousands of call sites, not a few. A strict style-src without
         this breaks the UI's appearance immediately; there's no build-
         time CSP-nonce injection in this Vite setup to do it properly,
         so this is a documented, deliberate trade-off, not an
         oversight to "fix later."
       - script-src is 'self' only, and dist/index.html was checked
         directly (not assumed) before writing this: one same-origin
         module script, one same-origin stylesheet, zero inline
         <script> blocks. Lazy-loaded route chunks (AppAdmin, Reports,
         etc.) are same-origin dynamic imports, governed by script-src
         same as the entry bundle — no separate allowance needed.
       - frame-src/frame-ancestors are both 'none'. Checked both
         external-navigation paths this could plausibly affect before
         locking that down:
           · Paystack/Stripe checkout — AppointmentList.jsx does
             `window.location.href = url`, a full top-level page
             redirect, not a form POST or an iframe. No CSP directive
             restricts top-level navigation, so neither provider's
             domain needs to appear anywhere in this policy.
           · Entra SSO — msalAuth.js calls loginPopup() (a genuine
             popup window via window.open, not an iframe), and this
             codebase has no acquireTokenSilent / hidden-iframe silent-
             refresh call anywhere — grepped for it, found none. CSP's
             frame-src does not govern window.open() popups at all, so
             frame-src 'none' does not block the SSO login flow.
             Flagged regardless: this reasoning wasn't exercised
             against a real Entra tenant in the build sandbox — smoke-
             test the actual login popup once this is live before
             fully trusting it.
       - Permissions-Policy disables camera/microphone/geolocation/
         payment/usb/magnetometer/gyroscope, none of which this app
         uses, plus interest-cohort (opts out of FLoC/Topics — a small,
         free, POPIA-aligned privacy gesture, not a functional
         requirement).
       - HSTS is max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains, WITHOUT preload.
         Preload submission is a much harder-to-reverse commitment on
         the customer's actual domain (removal from browsers' built-in
         preload lists can take months) — deliberately left as a
         separate decision for whoever owns the production domain, not
         defaulted on here.
     See MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx for the original
     finding this closes.
  ✅ HTTPS — Vercel auto-provisions TLS for every deployment; nothing to
     configure.

LOGGING / AUDIT (POPIA/FAIS accountability)
  ✅ Tamper-evident audit trail of who viewed/changed special PI —
     writeAuditLog() (auditService.js) is called from every state-
     changing route across Leads, Appointments, Users, Tasks — this is
     an enforced convention, not a one-off (the "A4 gate" — no new
     state-changing route ships without an audit write).
  ⬜ Special PI (ID numbers, medical detail) never written to logs —
     Vercel's own function logs are the relevant surface now, not Azure
     App Insights. Not specifically audited yet.

APPLICATION
  ✅ IDOR / Supervisor scoping — enforced server-side, consistently,
     across every domain that needs it: Leads, Appointments, Tasks
     (Agent/Broker: own only; Supervisor: self + direct reports; Admin/
     GlobalAdmin: everything). Notifications sidesteps this entirely by
     being always self-scoped regardless of role.
  ✅ CSV/Excel formula injection — closed (§ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES).
  ✅ Password policy (§72) — rotation, lockout, and calendar-year reuse
     prevention all admin-configurable and enforced; manually created
     users always forced to change their password on first login. See
     PasswordHistory above and Status_Vercel.md §72 for the full build.
  ✅ Token lifecycle — RESOLVED 3 Aug 2026 (§97). A single
     sessionsRevokedAt timestamp on User, checked as part of the same
     per-request lookup validateToken() already does for the isActive/
     isLocked check — no new query. A self-service password change now
     revokes every previously-issued token and immediately reissues a
     fresh one for the session that just made the request; an Admin can
     also force-logout a specific user without deactivating their
     account. A stolen token can no longer outlive a password change by
     up to 8 hours.
  ⬜ Rate limiting on authenticated endpoints — DECISION 3 Aug 2026
     (§100): defer to Vercel's Pro-plan WAF rate limiting rather than
     build a custom Postgres-backed limiter, since the customer's real
     deployment will be on Pro. Confirmed directly against Vercel's
     current docs that this is NOT automatic — it requires a Custom
     Rule actually configured in the Firewall tab against the
     customer's real Vercel account (dashboard action, not a code
     change), and it's a separately metered cost on top of the base
     subscription. Still an open, standing action item until that
     configuration is actually done — see §100 for the specific
     endpoints to prioritise and suggested starting thresholds.
  ⬜ Bulk-export / report exfiltration limits — not implemented.

CLOUD POSTURE
  Neon Postgres — connection via a standard connection string
    (executeQuery/executeQueryOne in db.js), not Azure's Managed
    Identity model. UPDATED §137 (12 Aug 2026): db.js runs on
    @neondatabase/serverless's neon() HTTP driver now, not pg.Pool — no
    persistent connection held between invocations at all, which is
    what actually fixed the Audit Log/Reports/Integrations failures
    §137 was built for (a stale pooled connection surviving Vercel's
    freeze/thaw cycle with no error handler on it, not a query bug).
    DATABASE_URL is unchanged either way. Backup/PITR is Neon's own
    built-in capability (point-in-time recovery), not something to
    configure separately the way Azure SQL geo-redundancy was.
  ✅ TLS certificate verification — RESOLVED AS A SIDE EFFECT OF §137
     (12 Aug 2026), not independently tightened. Originally found 30 Jul
     2026 (§70): db.js set ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } on the
     pg.Pool, so the connection was encrypted but the certificate wasn't
     verified. The HTTP driver has no equivalent override — it goes over
     standard HTTPS via fetch(), which validates the certificate by
     default with nothing in this codebase disabling that. Confirmed by
     reading the installed package's connection options (arrayMode/
     fullResults/fetchOptions/isolationLevel/readOnly/deferrable/
     authToken/disableWarningInBrowsers — no TLS-skipping option among
     them), not assumed from the driver switch alone.
  ⬜ Backup/restore actually tested (Neon's PITR capability exists;
     hasn't been exercised).
  ⬜ Least-privilege DB role/grants — the app currently connects with
     whatever privilege level the connection string grants; not
     reviewed for least-privilege specifically.

SUPPLY CHAIN / ASSURANCE
  ⬜ Dependency + secret scanning; SAST/DAST in CI — none configured.
     Manual npm audit review has been the practice this session (see
     Status_Vercel.md for the specific findings and decisions on
     react-router, xlsx, ESLint, Vite/Vitest).
  ⬜ Penetration test before go-live.

POPIA / THIRD PARTIES
  Operator (sub-processor) list for THIS version: Vercel, Neon, and —
  UPDATED §135 (7 Aug 2026) — Stripe (only once
  appointments.tokens.paymentProvider is actually set to 'stripe'; not
  usable for this specific deployment, Stripe doesn't support South
  African merchants at all), Paystack (same, only when the flag =
  'paystack' — the one actually usable here, Stripe-owned but a
  legally/operationally separate processor relationship), and whichever
  SMTP provider is configured (Resend by default, or a customer's own
  mail server/M365 — see emailService.js). Microsoft/Calendly/Zoho were
  part of the original Azure plan and were never integrated here.
  ⬜ Operator agreements: Vercel, Neon, Paystack (once enabled — the
     provider actually relevant to this deployment), SMTP provider.
     Stripe's own agreement only matters if a future non-SA customer of
     this codebase actually enables that provider — not relevant here.
  ⬜ Cross-border transfer assessment — relevant if Vercel/Neon's actual
     data-residency region isn't South Africa (worth explicitly
     confirming which region Neon is provisioned in). Neither Stripe nor
     Paystack ever see card details directly — both checkout flows are
     redirect-based (§134/§135) — but the broker's name/email/token
     purchase record still crosses to whichever processor is active,
     worth the same assessment as Vercel/Neon once actually enabled for
     a customer. Paystack specifically: South Africa-based Paystack
     accounts settle in ZAR and are themselves a South African-relevant
     entity for this purpose, which may simplify this assessment
     relative to Stripe — worth checking Paystack's own current data-
     residency/sub-processor documentation when this becomes live,
     rather than assuming either way from here.
  ⬜ Breach-notification process; Information Officer registered.
  ✅ POPIA Subject Access Request (SAR) endpoint — CORRECTED 20 Aug 2026,
     this line was stale (previously read "flag exists, admin endpoint
     not built"). Confirmed live this session, direct code read:
     sarService.js/sarHandlers.js/models/sar.js implement full request
     tracking (Received → InProgress → Fulfilled/Rejected, locked once
     terminal — assertNotLocked()), assignment to Admin/GlobalAdmin, a
     comment thread (SarComment), and compileSubjectData() — a genuine
     full export of everything MedBroker holds on a Lead (profile incl.
     decrypted ID number, call attempts, appointments + meeting history,
     tasks, the Lead's own audit trail), gated Admin/GlobalAdmin
     (sarHandlers.js requireRole). This is the POPIA right-of-ACCESS
     path (s23-s25) — see the new gap analysis immediately below for
     what it does not cover.

None of the ⬜ items above are live exposure today in the sense of an
active breach — they're go-live gates, appropriate to close before real
client PI flows through this system, not before then.

12a. POPIA / FAIS COMPLIANCE — GAP ANALYSIS AND BACKLOG
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Added 20 Aug 2026, at Mark's request, going into the client's Feb 2027
pickup break. Verified against a fresh GitHub hydration, code read
directly rather than inferred from prior session notes. Two specific
gaps Mark flagged going in are both confirmed real; a third
(unencrypted browser transport of security headers) was already tracked
above and is repeated here only because it's genuinely POPIA/FAIS-
relevant, not edge hygiene for its own sake.

GAP 1 — RIGHT TO ERASURE (POPIA s14(5), s24(1)(b)): CLOSED 20 Aug 2026,
SAME SESSION, FOR THE MANUAL PATH — SEE BELOW FOR WHAT'S STILL OPEN.
The description immediately below is the ORIGINAL finding, left intact
for the record; the fix is documented after it rather than silently
editing the finding away.

Originally found: deleteLead() (leadService.js) set only Lead.deletedAt = NOW() and removed
  the Lead's incomplete Tasks. Nothing else changed. Every other
  column — idNumberEncrypted, idNumberHash, dateOfBirth, medicalAid/
  medicalAidProvider/existingCover/currentInsurer/policies, email,
  mobile/whatsapp numbers, university/degree, hospitalOrPractice —
  stays fully intact and, for idNumber, still decryptable. The route is
  correctly role-gated (Admin/GlobalAdmin) and audited (LeadDeleted),
  and its own code comment already labels it "POPIA right to erasure" —
  the labelling is right, the implementation only does half the job.
  s14(5) requires destruction or deletion "in a manner that prevents
  its reconstruction in an intelligible form"; a soft-delete flag is
  the opposite of that by design — it exists specifically to filter a
  record out of active queries while leaving it fully reconstructable,
  which is exactly what deletedAt IS NULL indexes throughout this
  schema do.

  This is not simply "call the real DELETE statement instead" — FAIS's
  own record-keeping obligation (General Code of Conduct: client
  records kept a minimum of five years from termination of the
  financial service) is itself a lawful basis under POPIA s14(1) to
  keep some of what a Lead/Appointment holds, even against an erasure
  request. POPIA anticipates exactly this conflict: s14(6) provides a
  RESTRICTION path — stop actively processing the record, but don't
  destroy it — for information the responsible party is still
  authorised to retain (s14(6)(a): "retention of the record is
  required or authorised by law"). Two distinct capabilities are
  missing, not one:
    - TRUE ERASURE, for Leads with no live FAIS retention obligation
      (never progressed past initial contact, no appointment/advice
      ever given) — irreversibly strip or de-identify PII fields in
      place, not just flag deletedAt.
    - RESTRICT-AND-RETAIN, for Leads where a FAIS retention window is
      still running — PII locked from further display, processing, or
      export; the transactional/compliance skeleton (that advice was
      given, when, appointment outcome) kept for the statutory window,
      then purged on schedule.

FIXED, 20 Aug 2026 (same session as this gap analysis — Mark asked for
it as a companion build before the client parking break): both
capabilities above are now built, wired to a new SAR requestType
(Access | Deletion) on the existing POPIA request workflow.
  - getLeadRetentionPosition() (leadService.js) determines the FAIS
    position: a Lead with at least one Appointment reaching ClosedWon
    or ClosedLost has a live obligation, retention running 5 years from
    the most recent such closedAt. ReturnedToLeads is explicitly
    excluded — same reasoning as the standing "ReturnedToLeads must
    never count as Lost" reporting rule; verified directly against a
    real Postgres instance with a ReturnedToLeads-only Lead to confirm
    it correctly returns no obligation, not just read from the code.
  - eraseLeadPII() (leadService.js) — the true-erasure path. Anonymises
    in place (Mark's explicit choice over a hard/cascading delete —
    de-identification is an equally valid alternative to physical
    deletion under s14(4)): every PII/special-PI column nulled or
    replaced with a placeholder, deletedAt + erasedAt set. Referential
    integrity and historical reporting counts are preserved by design —
    nothing about pipelineStatus, assignedAgentId, region, or the
    CallAttempt/Appointment/Task/AuditLog rows pointing at this Lead is
    touched.
  - restrictLead() (leadService.js) — the restrict-and-retain path.
    Sets deletedAt (stops active processing, reusing the exact
    "excluded from every active-view query" mechanism every other
    soft-delete already relies on) + restrictedAt + retentionExpiresAt.
    PII is deliberately left fully intact — restriction is not early
    erasure.
  - executeSarDeletion() (sarService.js) orchestrates both, exposed as
    POST /api/leads/sar-requests/:id/execute-deletion (Admin/GlobalAdmin,
    §12a). AppAdmin.jsx's Data Requests tab has a request-type toggle
    at creation and an "Execute Deletion" control on Deletion-type
    requests, with a window.confirm gate (matches every other
    irreversible action in this app) and an outcome banner showing
    which path was taken.
  - Migration 035 (frontend/db/migrations/035_popia_erasure_and_restriction.sql)
    adds SubjectAccessRequest.requestType and Lead.erasedAt/
    restrictedAt/retentionExpiresAt. Verified idempotent by actually
    running it twice against a real Postgres instance — the first
    version's constraint-existence guard compared against the CamelCase
    constraint name, which Postgres never stores that way (identifiers
    fold to lowercase unless quoted), so the guard was silently a no-op
    and the second run failed. Fixed before delivery, not after Mark
    hit it against Neon.

STILL OPEN, logged as follow-ups rather than built this session:
  - The scheduled purge once a restricted Lead's retentionExpiresAt
    actually lapses — today this only marks the row; nothing yet
    automatically erases it once the FAIS window closes. IX_Lead_
    RetentionExpiry (migration 035) exists specifically to support this
    query cheaply once it's built — a cron mirroring the existing
    notifications/scheduled-tick job is the natural shape.
  - CallAttempt.notes / MeetingAttempt.notes free text can incidentally
    contain PII a staff member typed in. Deliberately NOT auto-redacted
    — the risk of either destroying genuinely useful records or leaving
    PII behind on a missed pattern is worse than leaving this flagged.
  - MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx's Section 6 (F2, and
    the "before go-live" list in 6.4) still shows this as Open/High —
    that file was not regenerated this session; its text is now stale
    on this one point specifically. Correct it the next time that
    document is touched, rather than treating the gap as still real.

GAP 2 — FIELD-LEVEL ENCRYPTION SCOPED TO idNumber ONLY. CLOSED 20 Aug
2026 (F1, security audit) — description below is the original finding,
kept intact for the record; resolution follows it.

  Originally found: carried forward from the Jun 2026 code review
  (finding E4, MedBroker_Security_Code_Review_Findings.docx) — confirmed
  unchanged by reading encryption.js directly this session. idNumberEncrypted/
  idNumberHash use genuinely solid envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM,
  random per-value data key, KMS- or DEMO_ENCRYPTION_KEY-wrapped,
  format-versioned for clean key-scheme migration) — this is not the
  weak point. Every other Lead field sits in application-layer
  plaintext: dateOfBirth, email/mobile/whatsapp, hospitalOrPractice,
  occupation, university/degree, and — the fields closest to POPIA
  s26's "special personal information" (health) — medicalAid/
  medicalAidProvider/existingCover/currentInsurer/policies.
  Neon provides disk-level encryption at rest as a platform default,
  which covers "someone steals the physical storage volume" — it does
  not cover "someone with valid DB credentials, or a SQL injection
  foothold, reads the table," which is the more realistic exposure for
  a hosted Postgres deployment and the actual reason idNumber got
  field-level treatment in the first place.

  FIXED, 20 Aug 2026 — Mark's decision: extend field-level encryption to
  exactly the five fields recommended (medicalAid, medicalAidProvider,
  existingCover, currentInsurer, policies), not dateOfBirth/contact
  fields (kept plaintext deliberately — genuinely useful for search/
  matching, lower risk in isolation). Migration 036 adds five
  *Encrypted columns; the five old plaintext columns are kept, not
  dropped, same "deprecated, unused going forward" treatment as Lead.
  portfolioId elsewhere in this schema. encryption.js gained two small
  wrappers (encryptBoolean/decryptBoolean) since medicalAid/
  existingCover are booleans and there's no encrypted-boolean column
  type — encrypted as 'true'/'false' text, parsed back on decrypt.
  Every read/write path updated: createLead(), updateLead(), getLeadById()
  (leadService.js), the Lead-join query in getAppointmentById()
  (appointmentService.js), compileSubjectData() (sarService.js), and the
  bulk export (dataExportService.js) — all decrypt for their existing
  legitimate use, none newly masked (unlike idNumber's export masking —
  these five don't carry idNumber's unique-identifier correlation risk,
  and F1 closes an at-rest encryption gap, not an export-policy
  question). listLeads() DROPS these fields entirely rather than
  decrypting them — checked LeadList.jsx first: it never rendered them,
  so decrypting per-row on every list page load would have been pure
  cost with no UI benefit. scripts/backfill-encrypt-lead-fields.js
  migrates any pre-existing plaintext data into the new columns; not
  run automatically, see that script's own header for why and how.

  DISCOVERED WHILE BUILDING THIS, NOT RELATED TO F1 ITSELF: Lead.
  currentInsurer had a working input on LeadDetail.jsx that sent a
  value on every save, but the field was never in CreateLeadShape
  (models/lead.js) at all — Zod silently stripped it before the request
  ever reached the service layer, so it never actually persisted, on
  any Lead, ever. Not a regression from this session's work; a
  pre-existing gap this work happened to touch every call site needed
  to fix (same shape of finding as the FLAG_META gap and the
  LeadUpdated audit-gate gap earlier in this project's history). Fixed
  as part of this change, since encrypting a field that couldn't be
  saved in the first place would have made no functional sense.

GAP 3 — BROWSER SECURITY HEADERS (repeated from the control list above
for POPIA s19 "appropriate technical measures" framing specifically).
  vercel.json sets no CSP/HSTS/X-Content-Type-Options/Referrer-Policy/
  Permissions-Policy — only Cache-Control on /assets. No defense-in-
  depth against XSS beyond React's default JSX escaping. Cheap, low-
  risk fix — see the security audit addendum (docs/security/) for the
  actual header block to add.

CARRIED FORWARD, UNCHANGED FROM THE EXISTING CONTROL LIST ABOVE:
operator agreements (Vercel/Neon/Paystack/SMTP), the cross-border
transfer assessment (confirm Neon's actual provisioning region),
breach-notification process, and Information Officer registration.

BACKLOG — ADD TO Status_Vercel.md OUTSTANDING ITEMS, COMPLIANCE-CRITICAL,
CLOSE BEFORE COMMERCIAL GO-LIVE (none are live exposure today — same
framing as the ⬜ list above):
  1. CLOSED 20 Aug 2026 — Lead erasure/anonymisation capability, both
     the true-erasure and restrict-and-retain paths from Gap 1, wired to
     a new requestType (Access | Deletion) on the SAR workflow. The
     scheduled purge-after-retention-window job remains open — see Gap
     1's "STILL OPEN" note above.
  2. CLOSED 20 Aug 2026 — field-level encryption extended to
     medicalAid/medicalAidProvider/existingCover/currentInsurer/policies
     (Gap 2/F1), migration 036. Full detail in Gap 2 above, including
     the pre-existing currentInsurer save bug fixed alongside it.
  3. CLOSED 20 Aug 2026 — vercel.json security headers (Gap 3/F3). Full
     detail in the SECURITY POSTURE control list above.
  4. Confirm Neon's provisioning region; complete the cross-border
     transfer assessment if it isn't South Africa.
  5. Operator agreements: Vercel, Neon, Paystack, SMTP provider.
  6. Breach-notification process documented; Information Officer
     registered with the Information Regulator.
  7. Formal data retention schedule — per-record-type, not ad hoc:
     FAIS's five-year minimum for transaction/advice records against
     POPIA's default "no longer than necessary for the purpose" for
     everything else. Item 1's erase-vs-restrict decision needs this as
     a concrete ruleset, not a per-request judgement call.
  8. Enable security.kmsEncryption.enabled for the actual client
     production deployment before go-live. Off by default today, which
     means DEMO_ENCRYPTION_KEY — an unrotated Vercel env var — is what
     actually protects idNumber in practice until this flag is switched
     on and AWS KMS is configured.
  9. Scheduled purge job for restricted Leads whose retentionExpiresAt
     has lapsed — currently a manual future action; IX_Lead_
     RetentionExpiry (migration 035) exists to support it cheaply. Not
     urgent until the first restricted Lead's five-year window is
     actually close to running out.

DEFERRED, NOT COMPLIANCE-CRITICAL — revisit only when a live prospect
requires it, not proactively:
  10. Cosmetic rebrand (name + logo + login/email copy) and the bigger
      decision behind it — generalising the Lead data model for non-
      medical lead-management verticals (custom-fields/vertical-config
      layer vs. forking per vertical). Both discussed with Mark 20 Aug
      2026: the rebrand is cheap but pointless in isolation — it only
      matters alongside making this sellable to a second brokerage or
      vertical, which is the real, much bigger decision. Do not build
      either speculatively; revisit when a second vertical is a live
      prospect, not before.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
13. KNOWN DECISIONS AND RATIONALE (SELECTED — VERCEL-RELEVANT ONLY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Lead statuses reduced to 5: Won/Lost outcome lives on Appointment
  (customerSigned), not on Lead. Lead only needs to know if the pipeline
  is open or closed.

Lead <-> Appointment cardinality is one-to-many (changed 23 Jul 2026): a
  Lead can accumulate multiple Appointment rows over time (a failed
  attempt, a Reopen, a second attempt), all preserved as history. "The"
  appointment shown on Lead Detail is the most recent by createdAt; the
  full set is surfaced via LeadDetail's Appointment History card and
  GET /api/appointments?leadId=.

Claim model — no admin confirmation step: claiming is immediate. Broker
  clicks Claim -> appointment status = Assigned -> appears in My
  Appointments. No ClaimPending status, no admin confirmation queue.

Close as Lost — built 24 Aug 2026, Mark's explicit request, following his
  own live testing (Status_Vercel.md's outstanding-items log has the full
  session). Real gap: the Outcome card (Customer Signed Yes/No) only ever
  renders once outcomeDue is true, which only ever becomes true from a
  meeting attempt actually resolving Held; a lead that only ever cancels,
  reschedules, or is missed — never once held — had no path to Closed
  Lost at all, only Return to Leads (an administrative reset, not a
  sales-loss outcome). Frontend-only addition: a new "Not progressing? /
  Close as Lost" button (AppointmentDetail.jsx), visible whenever
  !isLocked && !outcomeDue, opening a modal that calls the SAME
  appointmentsApi.saveOutcome() the Outcome card itself uses
  (customerSigned: false + required lostReason). No backend change was
  needed — saveOutcome()'s only precondition has always been
  current.status, never outcomeDue or a held meeting — so this shipped
  with zero new migrations, routes, or Vercel functions. One genuine
  adjacent gap found and fixed in the same delivery, not scope creep: the
  Outcome card's render gate broadened from outcomeDue alone to
  (outcomeDue || isLocked) — it's also what carries the ReturnedToLeads
  locked-notice and the ClosedLost Reopen button, both gated on
  appt.status directly, so ANY appointment locked without a held meeting
  (Return to Leads before a meeting, or now Close as Lost) previously
  rendered neither. lostReason also added to the AppointmentOutcomeSaved
  audit changeDetail (appointmentHandlers.js) and to AuditLogList.jsx's
  own rendering — a pre-existing omission on ANY outcome save, not
  specific to this feature, fixed here because this feature is what
  surfaced it. Undo path is the existing ClosedLost Reopen button
  (reopenAppointment() only checks status, not how it got there) — no new
  undo mechanism needed.

POPIA erasure/restriction closes open Appointments — built 24 Aug 2026,
  same session, following directly from Mark's own live testing (an
  erased Lead's Appointment still showing under the Appointments Active
  tab, still "Assigned"). eraseLeadPII()/restrictLead() (leadService.js)
  only ever touched the Lead row; Lead.deletedAt already correctly
  excludes the Lead from every list/report query in this codebase, but
  nothing ever looked at that Lead's Appointment(s). New
  appointmentService.closeOpenAppointmentsForErasure(leadId) closes
  every non-terminal Appointment to ClosedLost (customerSigned: false,
  closedAt: NOW()), called from sarService.executeSarDeletion() for
  BOTH the Erased and Restricted outcomes — Restricted still requires
  processing to stop under POPIA s14(6), even though the data itself is
  retained intact for the FAIS window. ClosedLost, not ReturnedToLeads,
  deliberately — Return to Leads re-queues the Lead into 'Unassigned'
  for the next available agent, exactly wrong for a subject who's
  withdrawn consent. New, distinct lostReason category,
  'ConsentWithdrawn' (migration 038, CHECK constraint), not reused from
  the existing six — deliberately excluded from every user-facing
  "Reason for loss" dropdown, this is the only code path that ever
  writes it; renders as a display-only conditional <option> on
  AppointmentDetail.jsx's own dropdown, and as "Consent withdrawn
  (POPIA)" via LOST_REASON_LABELS in both Reports.jsx and
  AuditLogList.jsx. DESIGN QUESTION PUT TO MARK BEFORE BUILDING: should
  these count as genuine Lost appointments in Reports (win rate,
  conversion, Loss Reason breakdown), or be excluded like
  ReturnedToLeads is? Mark's explicit answer: include them, same
  treatment as any other Closed Lost — reportService.js already defines
  "Lost" strictly as status = 'ClosedLost' throughout, with no
  hardcoded lostReason list anywhere, so this needed zero report-query
  changes. Lead.pipelineStatus deliberately NOT touched, matching
  anonymiseLeadRow()'s own established restraint (§12a, 20 Aug 2026) —
  it's operational metadata, not PII, and deletedAt already does the
  only job that mattered. A real gap caught mid-build, fixed in the
  same delivery: the closure function originally wrote no audit trail
  at all; every other Appointment status change does, so it now returns
  the closed appointment ids and executeSarDeletion() writes a new
  AppointmentClosedForErasure entry per appointment (same "function
  does the work, caller records who asked" split this file already
  uses for eraseLeadPII()/restrictLead() themselves). Migration 038's
  idempotency was verified by actually running it twice against a real
  local Postgres 16 instance (installed in-sandbox for this), not
  assumed — same standing rule this codebase already holds itself to.

Date format standard — built 25 Aug 2026, Mark's explicit request,
  following his own live testing (SAR form showing a native date input
  next to a differently-formatted computed preview). Every read-only
  (non-editable) date across the app renders as 'd MMM yyyy' (e.g.
  "24 Aug 2026") — Mark's explicit choice, already the majority pattern
  found during audit, over dateFormat.js's own originally-stated
  DD-MM-YYYY direction (23 Jul 2026). THE RULE FOR ANY NEW DATE DISPLAY
  GOING FORWARD: check the column's real type in schema.postgres.sql,
  don't assume from the field name. A genuine Postgres DATE column
  (dateOfBirth, firstAppointmentDate, eventDate, SAR receivedAt/dueDate,
  Task dueDate) renders via utils/dateFormat.js's formatDate() — it
  reads the calendar date straight out of the string, never constructs
  a Date object, so it can't be shifted a day by the viewer's local
  timezone the way `new Date(dateOnlyString)` can. A genuine TIMESTAMPTZ
  column (createdAt, performedAt, callTime/followUpDateTime, any
  "…At" audit-trail column) renders via date-fns' `format(new
  Date(value), 'd MMM yyyy')` (add `, HH:mm` when time matters too) —
  formatDate() would be the WRONG tool for a real timestamp, not a
  stricter one; timestamps genuinely need timezone-aware conversion,
  DATE columns genuinely must not get it. Never toLocaleDateString()
  with no options object (falls back to the browser's own uncontrolled
  default locale) and never an unformatted raw value straight in JSX —
  both were found live in the app during this sweep (AppAdmin.jsx's
  sub.lastImportAt; Tasks.jsx's task.dueDate and task.createdAt).
  Deliberately NOT swept: PeriodSelector.jsx's getPeriodLabel() ("Month
  to date (August 2026)") — a named PERIOD label, a different category
  from a point-in-time date entirely. Deliberately left as flagged
  exceptions, not silently different: AgentDetail.jsx's lastCallTime
  column keeps a shortened no-year format (space-constrained recency
  column); AppointmentList.jsx's leadCreatedAt stays on
  toLocaleDateString() since it's a genuine timestamp already rendering
  the same visual shape, formatDate() would be the wrong (DATE-only)
  tool for it. Editable native date inputs (`<input type="date">`,
  every editable date field app-wide) are EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE here —
  Mark's own explicit decision, 25 Aug 2026: they render in the
  browser/OS locale, genuinely outside CSS/JS control without replacing
  them with a custom picker component, and that replacement is a
  separate, deliberately deferred follow-up (real trade-off against the
  native picker's mobile/OS-integration/accessibility advantages, not
  just a build task) — not something to assume alongside this fix.

Custom date picker (DatePicker.jsx) — built 25 Aug 2026, same session,
  the follow-up explicitly deferred above, done same day on Mark's
  request. INTERNAL/STAFF FORMS ONLY, Mark's explicit scope call —
  LeadNew, LeadDetail, AppointmentDetail, Tasks, AppAdmin. The three
  Portal forms (PortalRegister, PortalCheckinConfirm, PortalActivate)
  deliberately keep the native `<input type="date">` — a one-time
  anonymous mobile visitor benefits more from the OS's own polished
  picker than from matching MedBroker's own visual language; staff who
  live in this app daily benefit the other way. THE RULE FOR ANY NEW
  EDITABLE DATE FIELD GOING FORWARD: internal/staff form → DatePicker
  (components/DatePicker.jsx), plain 'YYYY-MM-DD' string in,
  onChange(value) plain string out (not a synthetic event — matches
  EditableField/EditableFieldRow's own existing contract). Portal
  (public-facing, under pages/portal/) → native `<input type="date">`,
  unchanged, by design, not an oversight if a future Portal date field
  is left native. Before adding this to a NEW internal form, check
  whether the surrounding save/submit logic relies on native HTML5
  `required`-blocking with no JS-side validation underneath — Date
  Picker doesn't participate in that (found live in EventDetail.jsx
  during this build, the one file affected; fixed with one explicit
  `if (!field) …` check in that form's own submit handler, not a
  general problem for every form since every other internal date field
  already had independent JS validation). Value/typed-entry/calendar
  design and every deliberate scope line (no arrow-key grid navigation,
  absolute-positioned not portal-based) are documented in
  DatePicker.jsx's own header comment — read it before extending or
  copying this component elsewhere rather than re-deriving the
  reasoning.

SheetJS date-column parsing (LeadImport.jsx) — bug found and fixed
  25 Aug 2026, while building Mark a test file, not reported by him. A
  'YYYY-MM-DD' dateOfBirth column — CSV text OR a genuine Excel
  date-typed cell — was being silently corrupted into an Excel serial
  number by SheetJS's default parsing, failing every row with no
  visible reason. THE RULE FOR ANY FUTURE SheetJS/xlsx PARSING WORK:
  always pass `{ raw: true, cellDates: true }` to XLSX.read() when a
  date-shaped column is expected, and never rely on plain String(cell)
  for a value that could come back as a genuine JS Date instance —
  format it explicitly via LOCAL date parts (getFullYear/getMonth/
  getDate), matching the exact same DATE-only/timezone-safety reasoning
  utils/dateFormat.js's own header comment already established for
  read-only date DISPLAY (25 Aug 2026, earlier this session) — this is
  the same class of bug on the way IN rather than the way out. Verified
  by testing both failure cases (CSV text, genuine .xlsx date cell)
  directly against the real @e965/xlsx-aliased package before writing
  the fix, and testing the fix the same way afterward — not assumed
  from reading SheetJS's own documentation.

Role Configuration (dynamic, GlobalAdmin-defined roles + configurable
  permissions + configurable field visibility) — explored 1 Sep 2026,
  Mark's explicit question, purely speculative at this point: no
  concrete customer driving it, raised because a future customer MIGHT
  need it, and Mark wanted to understand the real cost before it
  becomes a live requirement. DECISION: NOT built. Documented here so
  the thinking survives to whenever (if ever) it's needed for real,
  rather than re-derived from scratch or, worse, guessed at without
  a real customer's actual role gaps to design against.

  WHY NOT NOW: MedBroker's current model is a fixed 5-role enum
  (GlobalAdmin/Admin/Supervisor/Agent/Broker) hardcoded as direct
  string comparisons — confirmed by grep, not estimated: 93 individual
  `role === 'X'` / `.includes(role)` occurrences across 32 files, both
  frontend (canManage/canEdit/isAdminRole-style checks — see
  AppointmentDetail.jsx:772, LeadDetail.jsx:277-286 for two concrete
  examples) and backend. A "GlobalAdmin defines new roles, configures
  what they can do and see" feature isn't an addition on top of that
  fixed model — it's a different authorization ARCHITECTURE. This app
  is bespoke for ONE brokerage with a known, stable org chart that
  already maps cleanly onto the five roles; dynamic role-building earns
  its complexity serving many DIFFERENT organisations with genuinely
  different structures, which isn't this, unless/until "customers"
  (plural) stops being hypothetical.

  ONE THING ALREADY IN ITS FAVOUR, if it ever does become real: the
  data layer is closer to multi-tenant-ready than a typical
  single-client app already. Every service function touched across
  this whole project routes through resolveOrganisationId() — leads,
  appointments, SAR requests, exports, all of it. Tenant isolation, the
  hard part of multi-tenancy, is already done; a future Role
  Configuration feature would naturally scope to organisationId from
  day one rather than needing that retrofitted first.

  WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE, if scoped for real — six pieces, sized
  honestly at roughly 4-6x the largest single-session feature built in
  this project so far (the POPIA erasure/date-format/date-picker
  cluster, 25 Aug 2026), because it touches every authorization
  decision point in the app simultaneously:
    1. Data model — User.role (a string enum) becomes a foreign key
       into Role/Permission/RolePermission tables, org-scoped.
       Role.isSystemRole (or equivalent) is not optional: without a
       way to protect the role that manages roles from being edited
       into a lockout state, a GlobalAdmin can accidentally lock
       themselves and everyone else out — a classic RBAC footgun, not
       a hypothetical one.
    2. A permission-check abstraction replacing all 93 call sites —
       hasPermission(user, 'appointment.close_as_lost') instead of
       role-string comparison, on BOTH sides (the existing
       frontend-gates-for-UX / backend-re-checks-for-real discipline
       has to survive the swap unchanged). Backend needs a caching
       strategy — a DB join to resolve permissions on every request
       doesn't scale; frontend needs the equivalent of useRole()
       resolving a permission set once per session, not a raw role
       string compared inline everywhere it's used today.
    3. The permission taxonomy — the actual hard part, and NOT schema
       design: going through all 93 checks and working out what
       business capability each one really represents, then grouping
       into something a human can sanely configure — probably 30-50
       permissions (lead.export, appointment.close_as_lost,
       sar.execute_deletion, system_config.edit, ...), organised by
       entity and action. Too granular and the admin UI is an
       unreadable wall of checkboxes; too coarse and the flexibility
       that was the whole point never actually gets built.
    4. A field-visibility layer — net NEW, not an extension of
       anything. "What they can't see" is a second, separate axis from
       "what they can't do," and MedBroker has no generic version of
       it today — only two ad-hoc, hardcoded, non-role-driven masking
       implementations (credential previews in
       integrationCredentialService.js; ID-number export masking in
       dataExportService.js, see this file's own "Display-layer
       exposure" entry, app-builder skill, 25 Aug 2026). Needs its own
       model: role × entity × field -> full / masked / hidden.
    5. Migration without regressing the security audit — the five
       existing roles become seed data, configured to reproduce
       EXACTLY current behaviour; any drift here is a silent security
       regression against findings that have already passed audit
       (§192, 22 Aug 2026). Safest shape: keep the five as protected,
       non-editable system roles (see item 1's isSystemRole), and make
       only NEW custom roles actually configurable, at least initially
       — don't let "configurable roles" mean "the five audited roles
       are now editable too."
    6. Compliance re-validation — every role/permission change needs
       its own audit trail (this app already does this discipline well
       elsewhere — AuditLog, writeAuditLog() — just needs extending
       here), and the POPIA/FAIS posture needs re-checking against a
       model where permissions can be misconfigured at runtime, a risk
       surface that doesn't exist with fixed, audited roles.

  IF THIS EVER BECOMES REAL: let the actual triggering customer's real
  role gaps drive the permission taxonomy (item 3) — don't design it
  speculatively now and hope it fits whatever shows up later. A
  matching interview question was added to the app-builder skill
  (1 Sep 2026, "CRITICAL: Interview Before Building") so any FUTURE new
  build — not a MedBroker retrofit — gets asked this up front, while
  building it in from day one is cheap, rather than retrofitting it
  later once 90+ hardcoded checks already exist to unwind.

Browser regression suite — built 27 Sep 2026 (app-design-pass skill's
  own mandatory requirement; continuation of 24-26 Sep 2026's Reports
  redesign). e2e/ at repo root (sibling to frontend/, not inside it),
  @playwright/test pinned as a repo-root-only devDependency
  (medbroker-v1/package.json — deliberately never frontend/package.json,
  which ships to Vercel). Run by .github/workflows/ci.yml at the TRUE
  repo root (outside medbroker-v1/) as a job alongside a unit-test job —
  CORRECTED 27 Sep 2026 (later): that line was written before the file
  existed on GitHub; it only becomes true once Mark creates the file in
  github.dev (delivered standalone — see Status_Vercel.md). The suite
  also runs in the sandbox every session regardless. Two files: smoke.spec.js
  (every page, every role, renders cleanly) and interactions.spec.js
  (regression tests for specific real bugs, listed below).

  WHY THIS FOUND SO MUCH, EXPLAINED ONCE HERE RATHER THAN RE-JUSTIFIED
  EVERY TIME: vitest's 57 tests mock the database and test service-layer
  logic in isolation — they never render a real page, a real component
  tree, or a real role/permission context, so they structurally cannot
  catch a page crashing on a missing field, a NaN warning from a normal
  zero-state, or two endpoints returning inconsistently-shaped
  responses. This suite is the first thing in this project's history to
  drive every page, for every role, through a real browser with
  realistic data. What it found was not introduced by recent work — it
  was latent, shipping invisibly, waiting for the specific combination
  of role and data state that would trigger it.

  FIXTURE-SHAPE FINDINGS (the suite's actual value, not incidental
  friction): usersApi's user objects need `portfolios`/`products`
  arrays or UserAdmin.jsx crashes the whole page (`user.portfolios.
  length`, no `?.` guard) — found by running the suite, not by reading
  the component first. eventsApi.get() wraps its response in
  `{ event: {...} }`; appointmentsApi.get() and leadsApi.get() don't —
  checked each individually before fixturing rather than assumed
  uniform, after the wrong assumption left an event page permanently
  showing "Event not found."

  REAL APP BUGS FOUND: EventDetail.jsx's attendance bars divide by
  event.rsvpCount with no zero-guard (attendancePct, three lines away,
  already had the correct guard — these two just never got the same
  treatment) — a brand-new event with zero RSVPs is a completely normal
  state, not an edge case, and produced a real React NaN-attribute
  warning every time. FIXED, same guard pattern applied consistently.
  tasks.enabled defaults to false in FlagContext, and /tasks' redirect
  check runs on the synchronous first render, before the async /flags
  fetch can possibly have resolved yet — /events never shows the same
  class of bug only because its own default happens to already be true.
  NOT FIXED (a real design decision, not a mechanical one — show a
  loading state before gating? change the default? — out of scope for
  this pass), documented as a deliberately-still-failing
  interactions.spec.js test (test.fail()) so it stays visible in CI
  rather than silently working around it by excluding the page from the
  smoke list and forgetting it exists.

  A GENUINE SEMANTIC-HTML GAP, NOTED NOT FIXED: AppointmentDetail.jsx
  has zero heading elements of any level anywhere in the file. The
  suite's own health check (expectHealthyPage, e2e/fixtures.js) was
  adjusted to fall back to confirming <main> rendered real content
  instead of hard-requiring an h1 every page doesn't actually have —
  the right fix for the TEST, since forcing uniform semantic HTML onto
  every page is a separate, real piece of work this pass didn't do.

  TWO SCREENSHOT/TEST-METHODOLOGY CORRECTIONS, carried over from the
  throwaway harness this suite replaced: document.body.scrollHeight
  stays pinned to the viewport because a <main> element, not the page,
  is this app's true internally-scrolling container (confirmed by
  measuring scrollHeight vs clientHeight directly) — full-page capture
  or full-content assertions need that constraint temporarily lifted
  first (expandMainForFullContent() in e2e/fixtures.js).

  THE BIGGEST LESSON, cost real debugging time before it was found:
  Supervisor role hung on "Loading…" indefinitely on /reports and
  /leads/import specifically, reproducibly, in isolation — looked
  exactly like a real, role-specific app bug. It wasn't. Direct
  instrumentation (temporarily logging every loading flag from inside
  Reports.jsx itself, not guessed from reading the code) showed all
  four flags correctly reaching false — the page genuinely finishes
  loading. The suite's OWN expectHealthyPage helper was the bug: its
  fallback took one un-retried textContent() reading immediately after
  an unrelated h1-visibility wait had already timed out, and on a page
  that happened to still be rendering at that exact instant, that
  single reading caught it mid-render and failed a perfectly healthy
  page. Fixed with expect.poll() (retries its own read against its own
  timeout) instead of a bare read. STANDING RULE for any future test in
  this suite: any assertion on data-dependent content must poll/retry,
  never take a single reading right after a different check's timeout
  already expired — and before concluding a failing test reveals an app
  bug, run it alone with --retries=0 first; if it fails the same way
  every time alone, it's real, investigate the app; if it only fails
  intermittently in a larger batch, suspect the test's own timing
  margins first.

  Mark's own live testing (UserAdmin.jsx: the Create User email field
  closing the modal when its text was selected, and a "disappearing"
  password-visibility toggle — traced to ONE root cause, not two).
  THE RULE FOR ANY MODAL OVERLAY GOING FORWARD: a plain `onClick={e =>
  { if (e.target === e.currentTarget) onClose(); }}` on the overlay div
  is NOT sufficient to detect "the user clicked outside the modal" — a
  browser's native click event fires on the nearest common ancestor of
  the mousedown and mouseup targets when they land on different
  elements, so dragging to select text that starts inside the modal and
  ends outside it (entirely plausible selecting an email address, a
  name, any text near the modal's edge) produces a click whose target
  genuinely IS the overlay, closing the modal mid-selection even though
  the user never intended to click it. Every overlay in this codebase
  needs a `mouseDownOnOverlayRef` (a plain useRef(false), one per modal
  component) set in a new `onMouseDown` handler on the overlay
  (`mouseDownOnOverlayRef.current = e.target === e.currentTarget`), and
  the `onClick` guard extended to require BOTH:
  `if (e.target === e.currentTarget && mouseDownOnOverlayRef.current)
  onClose();`. A genuine click satisfies both; a drag-selection that
  merely ends up over the overlay does not. Fixed in 12 overlay handlers
  across 7 files this session (Tasks.jsx, EventDetail.jsx x3,
  LeadList.jsx, AppointmentList.jsx x2, UserAdmin.jsx, EventList.jsx,
  AppointmentDetail.jsx x3) — checked the WHOLE codebase for the
  vulnerable pattern before fixing only the one instance Mark actually
  reported, since the same bug was silently present everywhere else
  this same overlay pattern was copied. Deliberately fixed in place at
  each of the 12 sites rather than extracted into a shared
  "ModalOverlay" component — matches this codebase's own established
  convention (seen repeatedly across this project) of duplicating a
  small, well-understood JSX pattern per file rather than abstracting
  it, and a shared component would have been a bigger architectural
  change than the bug itself warranted. Two QR-display modals in
  EventDetail.jsx share one ref between them deliberately (never shown
  simultaneously, neither holds form data worth protecting) — every
  other site gets its own dedicated ref, since two modals with
  independent open/close state sharing one ref would be a real
  cross-contamination risk, not a safe simplification.

Products on Lead — built 14 Aug 2026 (§157/§158/§159, migration 028).
  Mandatory only on the manual Create Lead form (leadSource ===
  'ManualEntry'), exempt on CSV/subscription bulk import — Mark's
  decision, mirrors exactly how Portfolio-on-Lead already worked (§142
  item 2). Built as a full parallel to Portfolio throughout, not just the
  creation-form slice: also editable afterward on LeadDetail.jsx, also
  pre-fills into Book Appointment. Scoped to the Lead's selected
  portfolio(s) — no portfolio-independent product list.

Mixed-basis conversion metrics — ratio, not '%', wherever the shape is
  closedAt-scoped numerator over createdAt-scoped denominator (can
  exceed 100% in a period where more deals close than were newly
  booked). Started with Agent booking rate (§154, 13 Aug 2026), extended
  to Broker conversion and all four §151 breakdown-report Conversion
  columns 14 Aug 2026 (§158) — Mark's standing instruction going
  forward: this shape should read as a ratio, not a percentage, anywhere
  it appears; don't reintroduce a '%'-formatted version of it.

Unassigned Appointment Warning — built 14 Aug 2026 (§160, migration
  029), Claude's design (Mark delegated full scoping authority: "yes,
  please scope and build"). Fires N days (SystemConfig.
  appointmentUnassignedWarningDays, default 2, admin-configurable) before
  an Appointment's own date if it's still status = 'Unassigned' — the
  same status both claim and assign model leave a broker-less
  appointment at, so one check covers both with no claimModel branching.
  Deliberately NOT feature-flag-gated, unlike leads.autoUnassign.enabled
  — this is a pure notification (matching AppointmentReminder/
  CallbackReminder/TaskDueReminder, none of which are flag-gated
  either), not a job that mutates data. Recipient routing pattern worth
  reusing elsewhere if a similar need comes up: LEFT JOIN the relevant
  open Task (if one exists) and notify whoever currently holds it
  (respects manual reassignment since creation) rather than
  re-deriving a routing decision from scratch; only fall back to a
  fresh region-based lookup when no such Task exists at all.

Reports hero — PipelineJourney (components/viz/), designed 24 Sep 2026,
  delivered 27 Sep 2026 (app-design-pass skill, Reports page pilot).
  Replaces PipelineHealth. Signature dark panel at the top of the org-view
  Reports page (Admin/GlobalAdmin/Supervisor; Agent/Broker self-view is
  unchanged). Concept: the logo draws "MB" as one continuous stroke; a
  Lead's journey is the same shape, so four sequential stages form one
  spine in the logo gradient (#2F4FE0 -> #1A7FCF -> #17B6C9), forking into
  Closed Won / Closed Lost. Waypoint dots use the per-theme --pl-* tokens.
  STANDING DATA RULES — each already caused a real bug once:
    1. NEVER sum all six pipeline buckets. Sequential stages are scoped
       by Lead.createdAt, Won/Lost by Appointment.closedAt, and Closed
       Lost also counts leads closed with no Appointment (Lead.updatedAt).
       The headline ("N leads still in play") sums the four sequential
       stages only; Won/Lost shares use closedTotal as denominator.
    2. Won/Lost are parallel terminal outcomes from Appointment Booked,
       never a 5th/6th sequential stage — the fork is the data semantics,
       not decoration.
  STANDING RENDERING RULES: no overflow:hidden on .pj-panel (it clipped
  the tooltip to invisible — the background washes clip on ::before);
  waypoints are HTML buttons over the SVG, not SVG circles; every label
  sits below its dot; gradient uses gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse".
  Covered by three e2e/interactions.spec.js tests.

Reports chart language — completed 27 Sep 2026 (app-design-pass). Every
  chart on Reports is hand-built in components/viz/; Recharts is no longer
  a dependency and should not be reintroduced for a new chart. Components:
  PipelineJourney (the one bold hero panel), MetricStrip (any row of
  headline figures — never a grid of identical KPI cards), TrendLines
  (time series, monotone curves via curve.js), OutcomeFlow (closed deals:
  region -> won/lost -> loss reason), PortfolioSplit (won vs lost per
  overlapping group), SplitFigures (a 2-3 way split), ReasonRows (reasons
  that each count once), CallFlow (Agent Detail hero: calls -> reached ->
  outcome), AppointmentFlow (Broker Detail hero: this period's
  appointments by where each stands now), both drawn by OrbitPanel since
  28 Sep 2026 (Mark's pick; BranchFlow retired); ValueStroke (signed value by product — dark hero or 'plain'
  section variant). One dark signature panel per page (.pj-panel):
  Reports = PipelineJourney, Agent Detail = CallFlow, Broker Detail =
  AppointmentFlow, Appointment Detail = LeadJourney (one lead's path on a
  real time scale; rules in leadJourneyModel.js, unit-tested), Leads list =
  the journey band (LeadRowJourney; every row on one shared 60-day scale,
  today at the right; rules in leadRowModel.js, unit-tested — "quiet" is
  >7 days without contact on a lead still with the agent; the list's
  "Longest without contact" sort, sortKey 'quiet', uses the same rule).
  SIZING RULE for any drawing inside a TABLE cell: absolutely position the
  SVG in a fixed-height box so it never sizes the column (29 Sep 2026 —
  otherwise auto table layout pins the column and resize needs a refresh).
  THEME RULE (Mark, 28 Sep 2026): signature panels FOLLOW THE THEME — every
  colour inside a .pj-panel comes from that theme's --hero-* and --path-*
  tokens in themes.css (dark themes: a deep panel in their own hue; light
  themes: a light panel with a hairline border). Never hard-code a colour
  on a panel descendant, in CSS or JSX; add a token. No data-theme="dark"
  overrides. Screenshot all four themes after any panel change. CONVERSION RATIO everywhere is §157/§158's deliberate
  throughput ratio (closed this period ÷ booked this period) — label it as
  such, never as a share.
  CHOOSING A VISUAL (Mark's decision, 28 Sep 2026) — by data shape, never
  a view switch: hierarchy (total -> parts -> sub-parts) = Orbit; items
  moving between two independent breakdowns = Flow; stages in sequence =
  Journey. Orbit keeps every count and share in its legend, one tick per
  item up to 120 (then one per N, stated on screen). Text inside it uses
  fixed light colours (no dark token set exists for data-theme="dark"). NO RINGS: BreakdownRing/DonutBreakdown were
  retired 27 Sep 2026 (evening) after Mark found them small and
  unimpactful — don't reintroduce a donut for a new breakdown.
  FLOW RULES: only draw a flow where the bands genuinely sum (every item in
  exactly one category, one time basis); draw any remainder as its own
  named branch; never trace through a cross-breakdown the data doesn't
  have. Portfolio counts overlap (a deal counts in every portfolio it
  covers) — never show them as shares of a total.
  STANDING RULES: every mark answers hover AND keyboard focus; a floating
  tooltip never goes above its chart or inside a clipping container (use
  the side-hung card, or an inline/centre readout); focus uses the app's
  own :focus-visible ring, not a second outline; "Not captured" is
  hatched, never a palette colour; raw enum values never reach the screen
  (map them, as Meeting Type now does); trend buckets flagged `future`
  (reportService, getDashboardReport) are never drawn as zeros; SVGs are
  drawn in measured pixels (useElementWidth), never a stretched viewBox.
  Supporting surfaces are theme-aware and quiet — only the hero is dark.

Continuous integration — .github/workflows/ci.yml at the TRUE repo root
  (outside medbroker-v1/), 27 Sep 2026, Mark's decision once it was
  explained. STATUS 27 Sep 2026: on main as plain `ci.yml` at the repo
  root, NOT in .github/workflows/ — so not yet running; Mark to move it.
  Two jobs on every push: unit (vitest) and e2e (Playwright,
  API fully mocked — no database, no secrets). Runs on GitHub's servers,
  works with github.dev drag-and-drop commits, does not gate or touch
  Vercel deploys. DELIVERY RULE: anything outside medbroker-v1/ (this
  file included) is never put in a delivery ZIP — hidden dot-folders get
  lost on macOS and a second top-level folder breaks the unzip. Deliver
  it standalone with its exact path and github.dev instructions. The root
  medbroker-v1/package-lock.json must stay in the repo: the e2e job's
  `npm ci` requires it. No lint job until the pre-existing lint error is
  fixed.

Donut pattern (DonutBreakdown, ReportsWidgets.jsx) — CURRENT DESIGN as
  of 16 Aug 2026 (§187), a structural rebuild after six earlier passes
  (§175, §178, §179, §180, §183, §184, §186 — seven, actually) each
  fixed something real without ever landing Mark's actual point: the
  component had almost no visual weight of its own, so no amount of
  show/hide or interactivity logic could make a row of them read as
  intentional. §187 was built directly from a reference dashboard Mark
  supplied, keeping this app's own theme tokens throughout (Mark's
  explicit instruction — structural rebuild, not a re-skin). Read this
  note, not the git-archaeology of how it got here, for what the
  component actually does today:

  Card is 360px wide (up from 220px — needs to hold a donut AND a real
  side legend together, not stacked in a narrow column), donut 104px
  with a CENTRE LABEL (the total count, via a position:absolute overlay
  div — simpler and more controllable than fighting Recharts' own
  <Label> geometry). Legend sits BESIDE the donut, not below it, one row
  per category, each showing the VALUE AND PERCENTAGE inline, ALWAYS —
  never hover-only. Hover still works (Tooltip unchanged from §179,
  cursor={false} still mandatory — see below) but is a bonus on top of
  always-visible numbers now, not the only way to see them. Each legend
  row uses alignItems:'flex-start' (not centre) so a long label
  (cancellation/loss reasons routinely run 25-35 characters) wraps onto
  a second line without dragging the value/% column down with it.

  ONE CONSISTENT TREATMENT for 1 category or many — §184's separate
  "compact stat" branch (no ring, just a bare number, for a single real
  category) is GONE. A real donut with a centre label and a legend row
  is MORE informative at n=1 than a bare number ever was — it still
  shows the count, the label, AND the percentage in the same visual
  language as every other card — and having two different visual
  treatments for "one category" vs "many" was itself part of why the
  page didn't read as one coherent product. A genuine 0-value category
  (e.g. Closed Lost when nothing's been lost yet) now gets its own
  explicit legend row too ("Closed Lost: 0 (0%)") rather than being
  omitted — more complete information, not less, matching "show real
  numbers always."

  Both empty branches (total===0, "no data at all"; realTotal===0,
  "data exists but it's entirely the Not-captured bucket" — a
  genuinely different fact, wireable via the optional
  notCapturedMessage prop) still render inside the SAME card chrome as
  the populated case. Don't let either branch fall through to the
  generic EmptyState component — differently-sized, built for a
  different job (a whole section being empty, not one card in a set).

  Used ONLY for genuine parts-of-a-whole data (every item sums to 100%
  of something real), never for ranked tables or the sequential
  pipeline stages — §156's original restraint principle, unchanged.
  Optional `title` prop labels an individual donut when more than one
  is shown side by side (e.g. "Region · Won" / "Region · Lost" as a
  pair) — the parent section's own heading isn't enough to distinguish
  them at that point; ALWAYS reserved (visibility:hidden when absent),
  never conditionally rendered — a title-less card and a titled card
  need identical internal structure for flexbox's own align-items:
  stretch to equalise a row of them correctly.

  cursor={false} on the Tooltip — MANDATORY on any <Pie> in this
  codebase, not optional. Recharts' Tooltip cursor prop defaults to
  true, built for Cartesian charts; a <Pie> has no "column" for it to
  highlight, so leaving the default on renders a stray rectangle
  unrelated to the chart (§179's own finding).

  shadow.sm on the card — same shared token s.card/s.metricCard already
  use everywhere else on this page and this app. CORRECTED 16 Aug 2026
  (§189) — §187's own first pass used one-off values (border:
  colors.lineSoft, radius.lg, shadow.xs) instead of these shared tokens
  (colors.line, radius.md, shadow.sm), a real inconsistency: the
  rebuilt donut cards had a visibly different border weight and shadow
  than their own immediate neighbours (KPI cards, Section wrappers).
  STANDING RULE: any new card-shaped element on this page should reach
  for s.card/s.metricCard's own values first, not invent a new
  one-off — "contemporary design system" means applying the existing
  system consistently, not introducing a second one beside it.

  CATEGORICAL_PALETTE is six fixed hex values, deliberately NOT theme
  CSS variables — needs to stay mutually distinct regardless of active
  accent theme, which a single rotating theme variable can't guarantee.
  Leaves the --pl-unassigned/--pl-assigned/--pl-progress/--pl-booked/
  --pl-won/--pl-lost tokens in themes.css (added 13 Aug 2026, §151
  follow-up, for a donut removed in the §156/§162 rebuild) genuinely
  orphaned — zero references in frontend/src as of 16 Aug 2026.

  STANDING RULE FOR THE ROW AROUND THESE CARDS, 16 Aug 2026 (§187): cap
  the wrapping row at maxWidth: 1160px (fits 3 of the current 360px
  cards per line) — with cards this wide, an uncapped row with only 1-2
  items (§186 correctly suppresses the rest some periods) will stretch
  across an entire wide monitor with nothing filling the remainder. A
  bounded, intentional grid, not open-ended width waiting to be filled
  — check this is still in place before adding a new breakdown row.

  EXTENDED 16 Aug 2026 (§189) — EVERY card meant to sit in this row
  must be a TRUE FLEX CHILD of the row's own container, never a
  separately-wrapped <div> below or beside it, even if it looks
  visually similar. Loss reasons was built as its own block with
  marginTop instead of a sibling inside the flex row — worked fine in
  isolation, but could never flow into leftover space in the row above
  it (By Portfolio · Won/Lost only filled 2 of 3 slots), so it always
  forced a new line regardless of how much room was actually available.
  Exact same failure shape as §183's own WonLostPair fix (a card
  outside the flex container can't be equalised or flowed by CSS on the
  container alone) — check for this specific pattern (a donut/card
  wrapped in its own <div> "just to add spacing") whenever adding
  anything new to one of these rows.

  LABEL LENGTH, 16 Aug 2026 (§189) — this page's own display labels
  (CANCEL_REASON_LABELS, LOST_REASON_LABELS, Reports.jsx) don't have to
  match the fuller, more descriptive labels used in the actual
  selection UI (AppointmentDetail.jsx's own dropdowns) word-for-word.
  The legend column here has real width constraints a full-width
  <select> doesn't; a label that reads fine in a dropdown can still
  wrap awkwardly in a 360px card's legend. When a legend label is
  flagged as too long, shorten the DISPLAY copy specifically rather
  than trying to fix it purely with layout (wrapping/truncation) —
  check whether the category name itself has an obvious shorter form
  first, and only reach for CSS truncation if it genuinely doesn't.

STANDING LAYOUT PRINCIPLE, 16 Aug 2026 (§182) — don't give related
  content its own separate full-width block/card just because it was
  built in a different session or a different pass. Before adding a new
  breakdown/chart/table to Reports.jsx, check whether it's the same
  underlying theme as something already on the page (Won/Lost by any
  cut, any breakdown of the same appointment set, etc.) and if so, put
  it in the SAME section, in the SAME flex-wrap row, not a new stacked
  block below it. Mark's own direct question after the §175-through-
  §181 saga: "why could these not be displayed next to each other?" —
  the honest answer was "no good reason, they were just built at
  different times." A single donut (or any card) floating alone in an
  otherwise-empty full-width row is the visible symptom; the actual
  fix is consolidation, not making that one card bigger.

  EXTENDED 16 Aug 2026 (§183) — consolidating into one flex-wrap row
  isn't enough on its own if any item in that row is wrapped in its own
  extra <div> (a group heading, a label, anything). align-items:stretch
  (flexbox's own default) only equalises TRUE SIBLINGS at the same DOM
  level — it can't reach through an intermediate wrapper to equalise a
  card two levels deep against one that's a direct child. When putting
  multiple DonutBreakdowns in one row, every one of them must be a
  direct child of that row — if a set needs its own label (a Won/Lost
  pair, for instance), put the label INSIDE each DonutBreakdown via its
  own `title` prop (compound titles like "Region · Won" work fine),
  never as a separate wrapping <div> around the group. This is why
  WonLostPair returns a bare fragment of two DonutBreakdowns now, not a
  labelled wrapper — check that pattern before adding a new paired or
  grouped donut anywhere on this page.

  EXTENDED AGAIN 16 Aug 2026 (§186), THEN REVERTED THE SAME DAY (§188)
  — §186's own reasoning: several secondary breakdowns in a row could
  each independently degenerate to "100% of the one thing that exists"
  — technically correct, still decorative, since they were each just
  restating the same headline number a different way. §186 suppressed
  any such breakdown that had fewer than 2 distinct real categories to
  compare. That reasoning was built against the PRE-§187 card design —
  §184's compact stat, a bare number with minimal visual weight. §187
  rebuilt DonutBreakdown to carry real weight (a centre label, a full
  legend with values and percentages) regardless of category count,
  which quietly removed the actual justification for §186's
  suppression: a single-category card isn't decorative anymore, it
  confirms real data and shows the exact count in the same visual
  language as every other card. Mark's own reaction on seeing §187
  applied — "where are all the other graphs?" — confirmed the
  suppression was hiding real, working data for no remaining reason.

  CURRENT STANDING RULE, post-§188: don't suppress a breakdown just
  because it's currently single-category. DonutBreakdown's own design
  (§187) is meant to carry real weight at any category count — trust
  that, rather than re-deriving a "is this worth showing" threshold at
  the call site. Show a breakdown whenever there's genuinely any data
  for it (the simple non-empty check, not a variety threshold). If a
  future pass finds a genuine reason to suppress something again, make
  sure that reason survives independently of whatever DonutBreakdown's
  own visual weight happens to be at the time — §186's mistake was
  coupling a display decision to a card design that was itself still
  being iterated on, so a later, unrelated change to the card silently
  invalidated the suppression logic without anyone revisiting it.

STANDING SKILL OBLIGATION, 16 Aug 2026 (§182) — this environment has a
  frontend-design skill (/mnt/skills/public/frontend-design/SKILL.md)
  that should be read before any UI/visual layout work on this page (or
  any page), not just component logic changes. It wasn't consulted once
  across the entire §175-§181 donut saga, and its own stated principles
  ("Structure is information," "treat failure and emptiness as moments
  for direction, not mood," "elegance is executing the chosen vision
  well") directly diagnose problems Mark had to point out manually that
  should have been caught before delivery. Load it before touching
  layout/spacing/empty-state design on this page again.

WonLostPair (Reports.jsx, page-local — NOT exported from
  ReportsWidgets.jsx) — built 16 Aug 2026 (§180) for Won vs Lost's new
  "By Region" / "By Portfolio" breakdowns, Mark's own explicit request
  for genuinely different data rather than a redundant re-rendering of
  the same Won/Lost split. Two DonutBreakdowns side by side (Won |
  Lost) under one shared heading, not a single combined donut — a
  "dimension × outcome" donut would need up to 18 slices (9 SA
  regions × 2 outcomes) for no real gain over two clean, honest donuts
  capped at 9 slices each. Deliberately kept page-local rather than
  promoted into ReportsWidgets.jsx — this specific "two donuts paired
  under one label" composition is a Won-vs-Lost-section concern, not a
  generic building block the way DonutBreakdown itself is; promote it
  only if a second, genuinely different section needs the exact same
  shape, not preemptively.

  wonVsLost.wonByRegion/lostByRegion/wonByPortfolio/lostByPortfolio
  (reportService.js, getDashboardData()) — region needed a genuinely
  new query (no existing breakdown grouped by region anywhere in this
  file before); portfolio needed none at all, derived directly from
  portfolioTable, already computed earlier in the same function for
  the existing Portfolio Performance table. Region's COALESCE to 'Not
  captured' matters — Appointment.region is nullable, only populated
  since 14 Aug 2026 (§166, migration 032), so any appointment booked
  before that carries none; same honest-labelling pattern as loss/
  cancel reasons rather than silently dropping those rows.

  REAL BUG, 16 Aug 2026 (§181), caught by Mark's own testing within
  minutes of delivery: the region query's first draft aliased its
  COALESCE output as `region` — but Lead ALSO has its own region
  column, joined into the same query, so `GROUP BY region` was
  genuinely ambiguous (three candidates: the output alias, l.region,
  a.region) and Postgres correctly threw rather than guess. STANDING
  RULE for this file, not just this one query: always alias a computed
  GROUP BY column to "groupKey" (matching every other breakdown query
  here — Lead Source, Portfolio, Meeting Type, loss/cancel reasons all
  already do this), never to a human-readable name that might match a
  real column on anything joined into the query. Region is the one
  dimension in this codebase that's a genuine column on BOTH Appointment
  and Lead simultaneously — the collision risk is real, not theoretical,
  and will recur for any future query that groups by it under any alias
  other than groupKey.

  THE REAL BUG, 16 Aug 2026 (§185) — "Lost" means status = 'ClosedLost',
  STRICTLY, everywhere in this file. mergeClosedMetrics() used to fold
  ANY non-ClosedWon row into "lost" (an `else`, not an `else if`),
  silently including ReturnedToLeads appointments — sent back to the
  pool, not a sales rejection. This directly contradicted an EXPLICIT
  design decision already on record from when ReturnedToLeads was first
  built, months earlier: "it's not a sales outcome, so lumping it in
  would skew win/loss reporting." §151 built mergeClosedMetrics()
  without cross-referencing that decision, and it silently spread to
  nine breakdowns through the shared helper alone, plus three more
  inline queries that hand-rolled the same pattern (getReportSummary's
  own pipeline bucket, and getDashboardData's own inline Trend/pipeline
  copies) — twelve locations total, found by grepping the whole file
  for every ReturnedToLeads reference and checking each one in context,
  not assumed identical from one match. Caught when Mark checked the
  RAW appointment table directly and found zero ClosedLost rows against
  a report showing "Lost: 1" — a genuinely different and more powerful
  verification method than anything used earlier in this saga (§180's
  region query was itself an attempt to FIX a symptom of this bug by
  matching the broken convention, making things worse, not better).

  STANDING RULE, not just for this specific bug: when a shared
  aggregation helper's behaviour seems surprising or hard to explain,
  check whether an EARLIER, more specific design decision already
  answered the question — grep Status_Vercel.md for the relevant status/
  concept before assuming a later, broader convention is the authoritative
  one. The broader convention here (mergeClosedMetrics' catch-all else)
  was actually the newer, less-considered one; the narrower, more
  specific decision (ReturnedToLeads excluded, stated with an explicit
  reason) predated it and should have won.

  Two OTHER ReturnedToLeads references in this same file were correctly
  left unchanged (checked in context, not assumed identical): the CASE-
  statement checks classifying whether a lead's most recent appointment
  is "still active" (AppointmentBooked pipeline stage) — a genuinely
  different question (is this appointment still open) from whether it
  represented a sales loss. Don't conflate these if touching either area
  again.

List sort — two genuinely different implementations on this codebase,
  by design, not inconsistency. AppointmentList.jsx sorts CLIENT-SIDE:
  the whole page is built on fetching every matching appointment in one
  request and filtering/sorting/counting KPIs against that in-memory
  array — no pagination UI at all. LeadList.jsx sorts SERVER-SIDE
  (LeadListQuerySchema.sortKey/sortDir, models/lead.js; listLeads(),
  leadService.js, mapping the validated enum through a fixed
  SORT_COLUMN whitelist of real column expressions, never interpolating
  the value itself) — Leads is genuinely paginated (25/page), so a
  client-side sort would only ever reorder whatever page happened to be
  loaded, silently ignoring every other page's rows. Building a new
  sortable list: check whether it already fetches everything (client-
  side sort is fine, simpler) or paginates (needs the real,
  server-side, whitelisted-column version — the Leads implementation is
  the template).

Appointments pageSize — REAL BUG, found 16 Aug 2026 (§177) while
  building the sort work above, not something Mark asked about
  directly: AppointmentList.jsx called appointmentsApi.list({}) with no
  pageSize, silently defaulting to AppointmentListQuerySchema's own 25
  (cap was 100) while the entire page treats the result as if it were
  complete. Cap raised to 2000, frontend now requests it explicitly —
  not real pagination, a deliberate choice to keep this page's existing
  fetch-everything architecture rather than rebuild it just to fix a
  default that was set too low. A visible warning banner
  (apptData.total > apptData.appointments.length) now covers the case
  where even 2000 isn't enough, so a future silent truncation is no
  longer possible the way this one was — if that banner ever actually
  fires, that's the signal real pagination has become genuinely
  warranted, not a signal to raise the cap again.

Manual Entry — its own page as of 16 Aug 2026 (§177), LeadNew.jsx,
  route /leads/new, gated on role only (Admin/Supervisor/GlobalAdmin,
  matching handleCreateLead's own requireRole() — leadHandlers.js).
  Previously tab 3 of LeadImport.jsx; moved out because it was
  accidentally also gated on that page's CSV/Subscription import
  feature flags purely by living inside it, despite having nothing to
  do with either. If any future feature needs "can this user create a
  lead" as a gate, requireRole()'s own list is the source of truth —
  don't infer it from which page/button happens to lead there.

Task generation — REDESIGNED 12 Aug 2026 (session 20 design, session 21
  build — see Status_Vercel.md §138 for the full history). Core test,
  Mark's own framing: a Task needs BOTH a concrete action owed AND a
  real due date. If either is missing — the action already happened at
  the moment of the triggering event, or the resulting state is already
  visible elsewhere without a dedicated queue item — it's a Notification
  or nothing, not a Task. Down to 2 event-driven rules (Callback,
  Assign-broker) from an original 5; Reschedule and Held/Outcome-pending
  both dropped to zero events entirely, not moved to Notification —
  their state is already visible on the entity itself. System-generated
  Tasks (Callback, Assign-broker) are deliberately NOT completable from
  the Task list — completion only happens by acting on the actual
  entity (logging a call on the Lead; assigning a broker on the
  Appointment), which auto-completes the Task as a side effect. Manual
  tasks keep direct completion. This has a nice side effect: it makes
  Tasks.jsx role-scoped without any filter code to maintain — Callback
  only ever reaches Agents, Assign-broker only ever reaches Supervisors,
  so a Broker's task list is Manual-only by construction.

Supervisor routing for Assign-broker tasks is by REGION, not by the
  agent's own line management — an agent's supervisor has nothing to do
  with broker capacity. Every User row (Agent/Broker/Supervisor/Admin
  alike) carries its own region and supervisorId columns already,
  region isn't broker- or agent-specific. Ties to a creation-time
  validation requirement: Agent/Broker require supervisorId at
  creation, Supervisor requires region at creation — otherwise the
  region-based lookup this depends on can silently come up empty.

SESSION-ISOLATION CAUTION (found 12 Aug 2026, session 20): AuthContext
  caches the active user in sessionStorage, which is genuinely per-tab —
  but the actual auth boundary, the mb_session httpOnly cookie, is
  shared across every tab in the same browser, InPrivate windows
  included if more than one tab shares one window. Testing multiple
  roles/users at once in tabs of the same browser WILL silently
  cross-contaminate which session is actually live for a given request,
  while each tab's own UI keeps showing whichever user it last rendered
  for. Produced at least one apparent "bug report" this session that
  turned out to likely be this, not a code defect — before accepting a
  live-testing bug report involving "the wrong user" as evidence of a
  code problem, ask whether multiple tabs/windows of the same browser
  were open with different logins at the time.

Self-service vs admin-editing split: PUT /api/users/me (self, narrow
  schema — displayName/avatarColour/themePreference/timezone only) is
  structurally separate from PUT /api/users/:id (Admin/GlobalAdmin,
  broader schema — role/portfolios/isActive). Deliberately not a
  permissive subset relationship — a self-edit can never reach a
  privilege field even by accident. The same admin-vs-self split pattern
  repeats for Task's isComplete-vs-everything-else permission boundary.

Cascade cleanup for Task exists because nothing else did: reassigning or
  deleting a Lead/Appointment now correctly reassigns or deletes any
  incomplete Task tied to it (deleteTasksForEntity/reassignTasksForEntity
  in taskService.js) — this didn't exist when Task's generation rules
  were first built, and was a real, if narrow, gap until fixed.

14. STANDING SESSION PROTOCOL (unchanged from before the split)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Hydrate from GitHub via codeload tarball at session start:
   https://codeload.github.com/mrdutoit/MedBroker/tar.gz/refs/heads/main
   Watch for the nested medbroker-v1/medbroker-v1/ double-folder
   artifact and flatten it before doing anything else.
2. Read Status_Vercel.md's current-state summary and this file before
   accepting any task.
3. Read tokens.js before touching any frontend component.
4. Flag scope decisions upfront before building.
5. Run npm run build + npx vitest run + node --check + an ESM import
   smoke test on every edited backend file before packaging.
6. Re-hydrate from GitHub and diff every file in a delivery against live
   state before packaging, when in doubt.
7. Update both Status_Vercel.md and this file at the end of every
   session — and, learned the hard way twice in one week: when
   something gets built, go back and correct EVERY place that used to
   say it wasn't, not just the newest summary. A disclaimer pointing to
   the "real" current-state section doesn't reliably stop someone
   reading the stale section first.

Delivery packaging (unchanged): single ZIP preserving repo-relative
folder structure, filename medbroker-<topic>-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.zip using the
actual current date/time, Status_Vercel.md/Project_Context_Vercel.md
presented standalone as well as inside the zip whenever either changes.
