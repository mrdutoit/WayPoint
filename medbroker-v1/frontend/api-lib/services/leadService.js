/**
 * services/leadService.js
 * Ported from api/src/services/leadService.js (Azure SQL / mssql) to
 * Postgres/Neon. Business logic and data access for the Lead entity.
 *
 * Changes from the Azure original — see VERCEL_NOTES.md for full detail:
 *
 *  1. SQL dialect only (no behaviour change):
 *       GETUTCDATE() -> NOW()
 *       [User]       -> "User"
 *       OFFSET..FETCH NEXT..ROWS ONLY -> LIMIT..OFFSET
 *       LIKE -> ILIKE (Postgres LIKE is case-sensitive by default; ILIKE
 *         matches the case-insensitive behaviour SQL Server's default
 *         collation gives the original query for free)
 *
 *  2. Real fix, not a dialect change: removed `l.leadSource` and
 *     `l.assignedBrokerId` from SELECT/INSERT — neither column exists on
 *     Lead (assignedBrokerId is Appointment-only by design; leadSource was
 *     never a column at all). Replaced with a computed `sourceLabel`
 *     (COALESCE across the four real source columns, joined to Event /
 *     MedicalSubscription) and wired `manualSourceName` + the `source`
 *     list filter, both of which the frontend already sends/expects but
 *     the original service never implemented. See models/lead.js header.
 *
 *  3. New: optional `supervisorAgentIds` filter on listLeads(), and the
 *     target-agent isActive check in assignLead() — the A1/A2 patterns
 *     Status.md describes as already fixed on this file, which the
 *     hydrated GitHub source does not actually contain. Implemented here
 *     per the documented spec. Supervisor scoping is applied by the route
 *     handler (api/leads/index.js), mirroring how Agent scoping already
 *     works in the Azure original — leadService stays authorization-agnostic,
 *     just takes the scope as a parameter.
 *
 * POPIA notes (unchanged from the Azure original):
 * - id_number is encrypted before insert and decrypted only when explicitly
 *   requested (POPIA Subject Access Requests — admin only, not built yet)
 * - Standard GET and LIST responses never include the plaintext id_number

 * and historical reporting counts, which a cascading physical delete
 * would silently corrupt. deletedAt is also set, reusing the exact same
 * "excluded from every active-view query" mechanism every other soft-
 * delete in this schema already relies on — no active-list query needed
 * changing for this to take effect.
 *
 * No performedById parameter — matches deleteLead()'s own signature
